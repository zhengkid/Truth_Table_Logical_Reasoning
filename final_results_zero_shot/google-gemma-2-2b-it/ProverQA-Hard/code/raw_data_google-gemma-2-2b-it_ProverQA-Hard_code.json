Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nMuffin is not reserved.\nFor any possum, if it has friends and is playful, then it is happy.\nEvery possum either has friends or is solitary.\nIf Muffin lives in groups, then she is either social or reserved, but not both.\nIsla is not reserved.\nAny possum that loves climbing or enjoys exploring is playful.\nAny possum that likes alone time and habits night roaming is solitary.\nMuffin has territory.\nMuffin is adventurous.\nIf Isla lives in groups, then she is either social or reserved, but not both.\nMuffin either has a good memory or is curious.\nIf Muffin is happy, then she is either curious or adventurous.\nMuffin enjoys exploring.\nIf Muffin is active, then she is either inquisitive or curious, but not both.\nIf Muffin is nocturnal, then she is either social or solitary, but not both.\nAll possums that either live in groups or have territory have family bonds.\nIf Muffin has a gentle nature, then she has friends and lives in harmony.\nMuffin does not have a good memory.\nMuffin is happy if she feels secure.\nMuffin does not have family bonds.\nLouisa either has a good memory or is curious.\nMuffin does not love climbing.\nAll possums that live in the forest are playful and have soft fur.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nMuffin is nocturnal.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nFor all scientists, if a scientist is renowned, then they either make breakthrough discoveries or receive accolades (or both).\nIf Dr.\nClark conducts innovative research, then he will either advance the field or improve existing processes, but not both.\nIf Dr.\nClark pursues a PhD, then he either dedicates his career to research or works in industry, but not both.\nDr.\nClark pursues a PhD.\nIf Dr.\nKylan conducts innovative research, then he will either advance the field or improve existing processes, but not both.\nDr.\nClark leads research teams.\nDr.\nClark conducts innovative research.\nDr.\nKylan publishes papers.\nDr.\nClark either conducts experiments or teaches at a university.\nDr.\nClark does not drive progress.\nIf Dr.\nClark either develops new techniques or makes breakthrough discoveries (but not both), then he will advance his field.\nAll scientists either study phenomena or develop new techniques.\nDr.\nClark either teaches at a university or works in industry, but not both.\nIf Dr.\nClark publishes papers and influences others, then he is renowned.\nDr.\nHarrison pursues a PhD.\nDr.\nKylan does not create new materials.\nDr.\nClark does not create new materials.\nIf a scientist develops new techniques, then they will drive progress in their field.\nEvery scientist who dedicates their career to research either improves existing processes or creates new materials.\nClark influences others.\nIf Dr.\nClark either leads research teams or teaches at a university (but not both), then he collaborates with his peers.\nDr.\nClark publishes papers.\nClark does not collaborate with his peers.\nAny scientist who studies complex phenomena or tests new hypotheses can advance their field.\nDr.\nClark dedicates his career to research if he is passionate about science.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nDr. Clark does not receive accolades.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
