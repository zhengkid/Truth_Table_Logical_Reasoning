Each tumpus is dull.\n14. Every tumpus is a numpus.\n15. Numpuses are not luminous.\n16. Numpuses are yumpuses.\n\nFrom the premises, we can trace the attributes of Max:\n\n- Max is a zumpus.\n- Zumpuses are dumpuses, so Max is a dumpus.\n- Dumpuses are vumpuses, so Max is a vumpus.\n- Vumpuses are jompuses, so Max is a jompus.\n- Jompuses are not large.\n- Each jompus is a wumpus, so Max is a wumpus.\n- Wumpuses are tumpuses, so Max is a tumpus.\n- Each tumpus is dull.\n- Every tumpus is a numpus, so Max is a numpus.\n- Numpuses are not luminous.\n- Numpuses are yumpuses, so Max is a yumpus.\n\nNow, let's consider the attributes of Max:\n\n- Max is not large.\n- Max is dull.\n- Max is not luminous.\n- Max is a yumpus.\n\nThe only attribute that directly relates to Max being angry or not is the fact that every impus is angry, but there is no direct link between Max and being an impus. Since the attributes of Max do not directly link to being angry, we need to check if there is any implicit link. The only relevant information is that every wumpus is not angry, and Max is a wumpus. Therefore, Max cannot be angry.\n\n<answer>False<end_of_answer>",

                "content": "You are a rigorous and logically precise AI assistant. Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nEvery zumpus is aggressive.\nZumpuses are yumpuses.\nWumpuses are not small.\nEach yumpus is not luminous.\nEvery yumpus is a jompus.\nJompuses are orange.\nJompuses are numpuses.\nEach numpus is earthy.\nEach numpus is a rompus.\nRompuses are not sweet.\nEach rompus is a vumpus.\nEvery vumpus is bright.\nEach vumpus is a dumpus.\nEach dumpus is small.\nDumpuses are tumpuses.\nEvery tumpus is cold.\nEvery tumpus is an impus.\nPolly is a jompus.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nPolly is not small.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true or false? Polly is not small.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\n"
