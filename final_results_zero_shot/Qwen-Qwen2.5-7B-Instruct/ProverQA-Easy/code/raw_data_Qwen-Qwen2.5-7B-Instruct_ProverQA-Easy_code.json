Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAbel becomes a community leader.\nIf someone helps others and makes a difference, then they can find a new purpose in life.\nHayden faces challenges.\nEveryone who faces challenges and seeks meaning can find a new purpose in life.\nIf Abel finds a new purpose in life, then he will either become a community leader or inspire others, but not both.\nIf Hayden finds a new purpose in life, then he will either become a community leader or inspire others, but not both.\nHayden becomes a community leader.\nHayden seeks meaning.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nHayden does not inspire others.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
