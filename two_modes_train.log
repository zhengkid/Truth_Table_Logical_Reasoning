    T: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often
    A: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events
    S: Bonnie is a student who attends the school
    I: Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in her community
    C: Bonnie chaperones high school dances
Premises:
    T → (A ∧ S)
    A ∨ I
    C → ¬S
    I → C
    (A ∧ S) → (S) 
    A ∨ ¬(A ∧ S) 
Logical Chain:
    From (6): A ∨ ¬(A ∧ S) 
    We can analyze this disjunction. Let's consider both possibilities:
    * **Case 1: A is True**
        * If A is True, then (A ∧ S) is True.
        * This leads to a contradiction with (6) as it implies ¬(A ∧ S) must be False.
    * **Case 2: A is False**
        * If A is False, then ¬(A ∧ S) must be True.
        * This means S must be False.
    Therefore, S must be False.
    From (4), if I is True, then C is True.
    From (3), if C is True, then S is False.
    Therefore, I must be False.
    From (2), if A is False, then I must be True.
    This creates a contradiction, so the premises are inconsistent. 
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):

| T (Performs in talent shows) | A (Attends and engaged) | S (Student) | I (Inactive and disinterested) | C (Chaperones) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|------------|-------------------------|------------|
| True                         | True                    | True        | False                  | False       |
| True                         | False                   | False       | True                   | True        |
| False                        | True                    | True        | False                  | False       |
| False                        | False                   | False       | True                   | True        |

Since the premises are inconsistent, the conclusion is uncertain.

    C → ¬S
    I → C
    (A ∧ S) → (S) 
    A ∨ ¬(A ∧ S) 
Logical Chain:
    From (6): A ∨ ¬(A ∧ S) 
    We can analyze this disjunction. Let's consider both possibilities:
    * **Case 1: A is True**
        * If A is True, then (A ∧ S) is True.
        * This leads to a contradiction with (6) as it implies ¬(A ∧ S) must be False.
    * **Case 2: A is False**
        * If A is False, then ¬(A ∧ S) must be True.
        * This means S must be False.
    Therefore, S must be False.
    From (4), if I is True, then C is True.
    From (3), if C is True, then S is False.
    Therefore, I must be False.
    From (2), if A is False, then I must be True.
    This creates a contradiction, so the premises are inconsistent. 
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):

| T (Performs in talent shows) | A (Attends and engaged) | S (Student) | I (Inactive and disinterested) | C (Chaperones) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|------------|-------------------------|------------|
| True                         | True                    | True        | False                  | False       |
| True                         | False                   | False       | True                   | True        |
| False                        | True                    | True        | False                  | False       |
| False                        | False                   | False       | True                   | True        |

Since the premises are inconsistent, the conclusion is uncertain.

1 out of 1 is correct!
Let:
    T: Bonnie is a student who attends the school
    I: Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community
    Y: Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities
    C: Bonnie chaperones high school dances
    E: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events

Premises:
    If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events. (P → E)
    Bonnie performs in school talent shows often or is an inactive and disinterested community member. (P ∨ I)
    If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then Bonnie is not a student who attends the school. (C → ¬T)
    All inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. (I → C)
    All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. (Y ∧ E → T)
    Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school. (E ∧ T ∨ ¬(E ∧ T))
Logical Chain:
    From (5), if Y and E are True, then T must be True.
    From (4), if I is True, then C must be True.
    From (3), if C is True, then T must be False.
    From (6), we know either (E ∧ T) is True or (¬(E ∧ T)) is True.

Consider the case where (Y ∧ E) is True:
    From (5), T must be True.
    From (3), if C is True, then T must be False, so C must be False.
    Therefore, Bonnie cannot be both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances.

Consider the case where (Y ∧ E) is False:
    From (6), this means (¬(E ∧ T)) must be True.
    Therefore, Bonnie is not a student who attends the school (¬T).
    From (2), this means Bonnie must be an inactive and disinterested member of the community (I).

Conclusion:
    The conclusion states that if Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community. 
    We have shown that in both possible cases, Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
    Therefore, the conclusion is **true**.

    If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then Bonnie is not a student who attends the school. (C → ¬T)
    All inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. (I → C)
    All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. (Y ∧ E → T)

3 out of 5 is correct!
Let:
    M: James is a manager
    C: James is in other countries
    H: James has lunch at home
    R: James works remotely from home
    C_B: James goes to the company building today

Premises:
    All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. (Implied: If James schedules a meeting with customers, then C_B is True)
    Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. (Implied: If C_B is True, then James schedules a meeting with customers)
    Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home. (H ∨ ¬H)
    If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home. (H → R)
    All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. (C → R)
    No managers work remotely from home. (M → ¬R)
    James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager. (C_B ↔ M)

Logical Chain:
    From (7), C_B is True if and only if M is True.
    From (7), if C_B is True, then James schedules a meeting with customers (from 2).
    From (5), if C is True, then R is True.
    From (6), if M is True, then R is False.
    From (3), H ∨ ¬H must be True.

Logical chain for the conclusion:

    Let's analyze the first part of the conclusion: "If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home."
    This translates to (M ∨ C) → (¬H ∧ ¬R)

    To prove this, we need to consider cases:

    * **Case 1: M is True:** 
        * From (6), if M is True, then R is False.
        * From (3), H ∨ ¬H is True, so either H is True or ¬H is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, the conclusion holds.
    * **Case 2: C is True:**
        * From (5), if C is True, then R is True.
        * From (3), H ∨ ¬H is True, so either H is True or ¬H is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, the conclusion does not hold.

    Now let's analyze the second part of the conclusion: "If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries."
    This translates to (H ∨ R) → (¬M ∧ ¬C)
    * To prove this, we need to consider cases:
    * **Case 1: H is True:**
        * From (4), if H is True, then R is True.
        * From (6), if R is True, then M is False.
        * From (5), if R is True, then C is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, the conclusion holds.
    * **Case 2: R is True:**
        * From (5), if R is True, then C is True.
        * From (6), if R is True, then M is False.
        * Therefore, in this case, the conclusion holds.

    Combining the results:
    The conclusion is true for the cases where M is True and H is True or R is True. 
    The conclusion is false for the case where C is True.

    Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.

    From (7), if C_B is True, then James schedules a meeting with customers (from 2).
    From (5), if C is True, then R is True.
    From (6), if M is True, then R is False.
    From (3), H ∨ ¬H must be True.

Logical chain for the conclusion:

    Let's analyze the first part of the conclusion: "If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home."
    This translates to (M ∨ C) → (¬H ∧ ¬R)

    To prove this, we need to consider cases:

    * **Case 1: M is True:** 
        * From (6), if M is True, then R is False.
        * From (3), H ∨ ¬H is True, so either H is True or ¬H is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, the conclusion holds.
    * **Case 2: C is True:**
        * From (5), if C is True, then R is True.
        * From (3), H ∨ ¬H is True, so either H is True or ¬H is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, the conclusion does not hold.

    Now let's analyze the second part of the conclusion: "If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries."
    This translates to (H ∨ R) → (¬M ∧ ¬C)
    * To prove this, we need to consider cases:
    * **Case 1: H is True:**
        * From (4), if H is True, then R is True.
        * From (6), if R is True, then M is False.
        * From (5), if R is True, then C is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, the conclusion holds.
    * **Case 2: R is True:**
        * From (5), if R is True, then C is True.
        * From (6), if R is True, then M is False.
        * Therefore, in this case, the conclusion holds.

    Combining the results:
    The conclusion is true for the cases where M is True and H is True or R is True. 
    The conclusion is false for the case where C is True.

    Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.

3 out of 6 is correct!
Let:
    M: A being has the Monkeypox virus
    A: A being is an animal
    H: A being is a human
    F: A being feels tired
    
Premises:
    M → Monkeypox (If a being has the Monkeypox virus, it may get Monkeypox)
    M → A (The Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals)
    H → A (Humans are animals)
    A → A (Mammals are animals)
    Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. (This premise does not directly imply the existence of an animal)
    F → F (People feel tired when they get the flu) (This premise does not directly imply the existence of an animal)

Logical Chain:

    From (2) and (3), we know that if a being has the Monkeypox virus, it is an animal. 
    From (3), we know that humans are animals.
    From (4), we know that mammals are animals.
    Therefore, we know that at least humans and some animals (those that can get the Monkeypox virus) are animals.
    
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    There is an animal. 
    This is a general statement about the existence of at least one animal.

Logical Chain for Conclusion:
    Since we know that humans and some animals are animals, we can conclude that there is at least one animal.

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| M (Monkeypox Virus) | A (Animal) | H (Human) |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| True              | True       | True      |

4 out of 7 is correct!
The premises state that "When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox" and "People feel tired when they get the flu." 
However, there is no direct link provided between Monkeypox and the flu. 
The premises do not state that Monkeypox is the same as the flu or that having Monkeypox prevents someone from getting the flu.
Therefore, it is uncertain whether or not anyone gets the flu.

    T: Rockie is a turtle
    S: Rockie is a squirrel
    C: Rockie is cute
    SC: Rockie is skittish
    P: Rockie can be spotted near the campus
    
Premises:
    All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. (P ∧ R → C)
    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. (∃T)
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (P → (R ∨ S))
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (SC → ¬C)
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (P ∧ S → SC)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (P ∧ ¬C)

Logical chain:

1. From (6), we know P = True and ¬C = True.
2. From (2), we know ∃T is True, meaning at least one turtle can be spotted.
3. From (3), we know P → (R ∨ S) is True. Since P is True, R ∨ S must also be True.
4. From (5), we know P ∧ S → SC is True. Since P is True, if S is True then SC is True.
5. From (6) and (4), we can deduce that S must be False, as Rockie is calm (¬C) and all skittish squirrels are spotted near the campus.
6. Since R ∨ S is True and S is False, R must be True.
7. From (1), we know that if P ∧ R is True then C is True. However, we know from (6) that ¬C is True, so P ∧ R must be False. This contradicts our earlier deduction that R must be True. 
8. Therefore, the premises are inconsistent, and the conclusion is uncertain.

Let:
    R: Rockie is a rabbit
    T: Rockie is a turtle
    S: Rockie is a squirrel
    C: Rockie is calm
    
Premises:
    All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. (R ∧ S → C)
    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. (∃x T(x))
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (R ∨ S)
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (S → ¬C)
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (S → S)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (S ∨ R ∧ C)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    Rockie is not a turtle, which translates to ¬T.

Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know S ∨ R ∧ C is True.
    We need to figure out if this implies ¬T.
    
    **Consider the possibilities:**
    * **Case 1: S is True:**
        * If S is True, then from (5) Rockie is skittish, so C must be False (from 4).
        * This contradicts (6), so S must be False.
    * **Case 2: R ∧ C is True:**
        * If R is True and C is True, then from (1) Rockie is cute.
        * This does not directly tell us anything about whether Rockie is a turtle or not.

    **Since we cannot definitively say Rockie is not a turtle (¬T) based on the given premises, the conclusion is uncertain.**

    Therefore, Rockie is a rabbit (R is True) and cute (C is True).
    From (4), if S is True then K is False, so K is False.
    The conclusion states that if Rockie is cute and calm (C ∧ K), then Rockie is a skittish turtle (T ∧ S).
    Since Rockie is not a turtle (R is True), the conclusion is False.

19 out of 29 is correct!
Let:
    E: Marvin is from Earth
    M: Marvin is from Mars
    A: Marvin is an alien
    H: Marvin is a human
Premises:
    All aliens are extraterrestrials. (A → E)
    If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien. (M → A)
    No extraterrestrials are human. (A → ¬H)
    All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans. (E ∧ H → H)
    Marvin is a highly intelligent being. (H)
    Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither. (E ∧ M ∨ ¬E ∧ ¬M)
    If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial. (¬E → A)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human, which translates to ¬M → H.

Logical Chain:

1. **Analyze the premises:** We have several implications and a disjunction.  
2. **Key premises for the conclusion:**
    * ¬M → A (If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an alien)
    * A → ¬H (No extraterrestrials are human)
    * H (Marvin is a highly intelligent being)
3. **Combine the premises:**  If Marvin is not from Mars (¬M), then he is an alien (A). If Marvin is an alien (A), then he is not human (¬H). Therefore, if Marvin is not from Mars, he is not human (¬M → ¬H).

Truth Table (for ¬M → H):
| ¬M (Not from Mars) | H (Human) | ¬M → H (If not from Mars, then human) |
|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| True               | True     | True                             |

| False              | False    | True                             |

Since the conclusion ¬M → H is not always true, the statement is false.

    Djokovic is at the mixer (Implied by the context)
    (A ∧ F) → W (Implied from the above premises)

Logical Chain:
    From (9), if Djokovic is at the mixer, then Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
    We need to determine if this leads to Djokovic being a Grand Slam champion (G).

    Let's analyze the possibilities:
    * **Case 1: Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion (G = True)**
        * From (2), if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, then Djokovic is a professional tennis player (P = True).
        * From (3), if Djokovic is a professional tennis player, then Djokovic is an athlete (A = True).
        * From (4), if Djokovic is an athlete, then Djokovic is famous (F = True).
        * From (5), if Djokovic is a celebrity, then Djokovic is well-paid (W = True).
        * From (6), if Djokovic is well-paid, then Djokovic lives in a tax haven (T = True).
        * Therefore, in this case, the conclusion is true.

    * **Case 2: Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor (O = True)**
        * From (3), if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, then Djokovic is a celebrity (C = True).
        * From (5), if Djokovic is a celebrity, then Djokovic is well-paid (W = True).
        * From (6), if Djokovic is well-paid, then Djokovic lives in a tax haven (T = True).
        * This case does not directly lead to Djokovic being a Grand Slam champion.

    * **Case 3: Neither a Grand Slam champion nor an Oscar-nominated actor**
        * This case is not possible based on premise (9).

Therefore, the only scenario where the conclusion is true is when Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.

    P: Djokovic is a professional tennis player
    C: Djokovic is a celebrity
    A: Djokovic is an athlete
    T: Djokovic is well-paid

Premises:
    Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. (G ∨ O)
    Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player. (G → P)
    All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities. (O → C)
    All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes. (P → A)

    All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens. (T → H)
    Djokovic is at the mixer: (Assumption)
    If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid. (A → T)

Logical Chain:

    From (8), we know Djokovic is at the mixer.
    We need to determine if H is True, False, or Uncertain.
    
    Analyze the premises:

    * **G ∨ O:** Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
    * **(G → P):** If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, then Djokovic is a professional tennis player.
    * **(O → C):** If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, then Djokovic is a celebrity.
    * **(P → A):** If Djokovic is a professional tennis player, then Djokovic is an athlete.
    * **(C → T):** If Djokovic is a celebrity, then Djokovic is well paid.
    * **(A → T):** If Djokovic is an athlete, then Djokovic is well paid.
    * **(T → H):** If Djokovic is well paid, then Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
    * **(A → F):** If Djokovic is an athlete, then Djokovic is famous.

    To determine H, we need to figure out if T is True.  

    We can analyze the premises step by step:

    1. **Assume G is True:**
        * From (1), G ∨ O is True.
        * From (2), G → P, so P is True.
        * From (3), P → A, so A is True.
        * From (4), A → T, so T is True.
        * From (5), T → H, so H is True.

    2. **Assume O is True:**
        * From (1), G ∨ O is True.
        * From (3), O → C, so C is True.
        * From (4), C → T, so T is True.
        * From (5), T → H, so H is True.

    Therefore, in both cases (G True or O True), we arrive at H = True.

    Since we know Djokovic is at the mixer (premise 8), and either G or O must be True, we can conclude that Djokovic lives in a tax haven (H = True).

Logical Chain:

    From (1), we know either G or O must be True.
    We need to figure out if this leads to T = True or False.
    Let's analyze each case:
    Case 1: If G is True:

        From (3), G → P, so P = True
        From (4), P → A, so A = True
        From (5), A → F, so F = True
        From (6), F → T, so T = True
    Case 2: If O is True:
        From (2), G ∨ O = True
        From (4), O → C, so C = True
        From (5), C → T, so T = True
    In both cases, we reach T = True.

Therefore, the conclusion is false.

    If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative. (I → (B ∧ E))

Logical Chain:
    We need to determine if B is True, False, or Uncertain.

    * (Z ∨ K) states that either Z or K must be True.
    * (K → E) and (K → D) imply that if K is True, then E and D are also True.
    * (I → (B ∧ E)) implies that if I is True, then both B and E must be True.
    * We can't definitively say if Z or K is True, so we can't definitively say if B is True.

        * From (1), Z → I, so I must also be True.
        * From (6), I → (B ∧ E), so B and E must also be True.
    * **If K is True:**
        * From (4), K → E, so E must be True.
        * From (5), K → D, so D must also be True.
    In both cases, we can conclude that E and D are True.
Truth Table (Simplified):
| Z (Zaha Hadid) | K (Kelly Wearstler) | I (Interesting Geometries) | B (Brutalist) | E (Evocative) | D (Dreamy) |

    If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative. (I → (B ∧ E))
Logical Chain:
    From (3), we know Z ∨ K must be True.
    Let's analyze the implications of each case:

        * From (5), if K is True then D is True.

    Therefore, in both cases, the design is either evocative (E) or dreamy (D).

Let:
    C: An item is a cat
    P: An item is a pet
Premises:
    All cats are mammals (C → Mammal)
    Some pets are not mammals (¬∃x(P(x) ∧ Mammal(x)))
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    No pets are cats (¬∃x(P(x) ∧ C(x)))

Logical Chain:
    The premises state that all cats are mammals and that some pets are not mammals. 
    This does not directly imply that *no* pets are cats. It's possible that the pets which are not mammals are a separate group from cats. 
    

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| C (Cat) | P (Pet) | C ∧ P (Cat and Pet) | ¬∃x(P(x) ∧ C(x)) (No pets are cats) |
|----------|---------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|

Let:
    D: 1984 is digital media
    A: 1984 is analog media
    P: 1984 is printed text
    S: 1984 is a streaming service
Premises:
    ¬(D ∧ A)  (No digital media are analog)
    All printed texts are analog (A → P)
    All streaming services are digital (S → D)
    If 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is printed text (P → S)
    If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book (S → P)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    P (1984 is printed text)

Logical Chain:

1. **Analyze the premises:** We know from (2) that if something is analog, then it is printed text (A → P). We also know from (3) that all streaming services are digital (S → D), and from (1) that no digital media are analog (¬(D ∧ A)). This means a streaming service cannot be analog.

2. **Consider the implications:**
   - If 1984 is a streaming service (S is True), then from (3) it must be digital (D is True). 
   - But from (1), if it's digital (D is True), it cannot be analog (A is False). 
   - Therefore, if 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be printed text (P is False).

3. **Analyze the remaining possibilities:** 
   - If 1984 is not a streaming service (S is False), then from (5) we know it cannot be a hardcover book (P is False).
   - Therefore, in both cases, 1984 cannot be printed text (P is False).

Conclusion to Evaluate:
    S (1984 is a streaming service)

Logical Chain:
    We can analyze this using truth tables or a chain-of-thought approach. 
    
    1.  The premise (S → P) states that if 1984 is a streaming service, then it is a hardcover book.
    2.  The premise (P → A) states that if 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is analog.
    3.  The premise (¬(D ∧ A)) states that 1984 cannot be both digital and analog.
    4.  The premise (S → D) states that if 1984 is a streaming service, then it is digital.

    If we assume S is True (1984 is a streaming service):
    *  From (4), D would be True (1984 is digital).
    *  From (1), this contradicts ¬(D ∧ A). 
    *  Therefore, S must be False.

Let:
    S: 1984 is a streaming service
    A: 1984 is analog
    P: 1984 is printed text
    H: 1984 is a hardcover book

Premises:
    ¬(S ∧ A)  (No digital media are analog)
    All printed text is analog media.
    All streaming services are digital media.
    If 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is printed text (H → P)
    If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book (S → H)

Logical chain:

1. **Assume for contradiction that 1984 is a streaming service (S = True).**
2. **From (2) and (3), if S is True, then 1984 is digital media, which contradicts (1).**
3. **Therefore, S must be False.**
4. **From (5), if S is False, then 1984 is not a hardcover book (H = False).**

Conclusion to Evaluate: 1984 is not a streaming service, which translates to ¬S.

Since we have derived ¬S, the conclusion is true.

    If 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is printed text (H → P)
    If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book (S → H)

Logical chain:

1. **Assume for contradiction that 1984 is a streaming service (S = True).**
2. **From (2) and (3), if S is True, then 1984 is digital media, which contradicts (1).**
3. **Therefore, S must be False.**
4. **From (5), if S is False, then 1984 is not a hardcover book (H = False).**

Conclusion to Evaluate: 1984 is not a streaming service, which translates to ¬S.

Since we have derived ¬S, the conclusion is true.

Logical Chain:
    From premise 4, we know B = False.
    The premises do not provide any information about Bismarck's location.
    Therefore, Bi remains uncertain.

Let:
    F: Mike has an F1 visa
    J: Mike has a J1 visa
    CPT: Mike applies for CPT
    OPT: Mike applies for OPT
Premises:
    All international students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa (F ∨ J)
    An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US (F → (CPT ∨ OPT))
    Mike is an international student.
    Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Mike has a J1 visa (J)

Logical Chain:
    From (3), we know Mike is an international student.
    From (4), we know Mike needs to apply for CPT.
    From (2), if Mike had an F1 visa, he would need to apply for CPT or OPT.
    Since Mike needs to apply for CPT, we can't definitively say he doesn't have an F1 visa.
    Therefore, Mike could have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| F (F1 Visa) | J (J1 Visa) | CPT | OPT |
|--------------|------------|-------|-------|
| True          | False      | True  | True  |
| False         | True       | True  | False |

Since we cannot determine with certainty whether Mike has an F1 or J1 visa based on the given premises, the conclusion is uncertain.

    Therefore, R = True
    The premises do not state that all stocks are growth stocks, only that some are.

Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    KO is a stock and a growth stock, which translates to S ∧ G.

Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know M = True.
    From (4), if M is True then R is True (KO is suitable for a retirement fund).
    From (2), if B is True then R is False (not suitable for a retirement fund).
    Therefore, B must be False.
    From (1), if G is True then B is True (all growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation).
    Since B is False, G must be False.
    From (3), we know that at least one stock is a growth stock, but this doesn't force KO to be that stock.

    Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul. (¬B34 → ¬I)
    Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. (I is True)
    Tom's license plate begins with the number 35. (B35 is True)
    If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34. (B35 → ¬B34)

Logical Chain:
    From (4), B35 is True.
    From (5), if B35 is True, then B34 must be False. 
    From (2), if B34 is False, then I must be False.
    Therefore, I is False.

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| B34 (Begins with 34) | B35 (Begins with 35) | I (From Istanbul) |

Let:
    B: Dried Thai chilies are a product of Baked by Melissa.
    S: Dried Thai chilies are spicy
    C: Dried Thai chilies are a cupcake
    BS: Baked sweets are spicy
    
Premises:
    ¬(BS ∧ S)  (No baked sweets are spicy)
    All cupcakes are baked sweets (C → BS)
    All mala hotpots are spicy (M → S)
    All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes (B → C)
    Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets (S ∨ M ∨ ¬BS)

Logical Chain:
    From (3) and (4), if B is True, then C is True.
    From (2), if C is True, then BS is True.
    From (1), if BS is True, then S must be False.
    This creates a contradiction. 
    Therefore, B must be False.

    All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes (B → C)

Logical Chain:
    From (3) and (4), if something is a mala hotpot, it is spicy.
    From (2) and (4), if something is a product of Baked by Melissa, it is a cupcake, and thus a baked sweet.
    From (1), if something is a baked sweet, it cannot be spicy.
    Therefore, a product of Baked by Melissa cannot be spicy.
    The premises do not directly state that dried Thai chilies cannot be both spicy and a mala hotpot, so we cannot definitively say they are not both.

    From (4), if M is True, then C is True.

    From (1), if B is True, then ¬S is True.
    From (3), if H is True, then S is True.
    From (5), we know either S, H, or ¬B must be True.
    We need to find a scenario where all three, C, M, and ¬B are True. 

    It's impossible to satisfy all these conditions simultaneously. 

    * If S is True, then ¬B must be False (from 1). This contradicts our need for B to be True.

Let:
    B: Dried Thai chilies are baked sweets
    C: Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes
    M: Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa
    S: Dried Thai chilies are spicy
    H: Dried Thai chilies are mala hotpots

Premises:
    ¬B (No baked sweets are spicy)
    All cupcakes are baked sweets (C → B)
    All mala hotpots are spicy (H → S)
    All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes (M → C)
    S ∨ H ∨ ¬B (Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    C ∧ M (Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa)
Logical Chain:
    From (4), if M is True, then C is True.
    From (2), if C is True, then B is True.
    From (1), if B is True, then ¬S is True.
    From (3), if H is True, then S is True.
    From (5), we know either S, H, or ¬B must be True.
    We need to find a scenario where all three, C, M, and ¬B are True. 

    It's impossible to satisfy all these conditions simultaneously. 

    * If S is True, then ¬B must be False (from 1). This contradicts our need for B to be True.
    * If H is True, then S is True, again contradicting our need for ¬B to be True.
    * Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Let:
    R: The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than 4
    T: The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service
    N: The Hamden Plaza Subway store receives many negative reviews
Premises:
    If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews. (R ∨ T) → ¬N
    All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations. (R → (R ∨ T))
    Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. (∃T ¬R ∧ N)
    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four. (P → R)
    The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. (R ∨ P)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service.  
    This translates to (T ∧ N) → (R ∧ ¬T)

Logical Chain:
    The conclusion is an implication. To evaluate it, we need to see if the premise can lead to the conclusion being false. 

    Assume for contradiction that (T ∧ N) is true. 
    From (1), if (R ∨ T) is true, then ¬N must be true.
    From (2), if R is true, then (R ∨ T) is true.
    From (3), we know that there exists at least one restaurant that does not provide take-out service and receives many negative reviews.
    From (4), if P is true, then R is true.
    From (5), either R or P is true.
    
    We can't definitively say that (T ∧ N) will lead to (R ∧ ¬T) being true.

    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four. (P → G)
    The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. (G ∨ P)

Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know either G is True or P is True.
    Let's analyze each case:
    * **Case 1: G is True**
        * From (2), if G is True then Y is True.
        * From (1), if Y is True then N is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, the Hamden Plaza Subway store has not received many negative reviews (N = True).
    * **Case 2: P is True**
        * From (4), if P is True then G is True.
        * From (2), if G is True then Y is True.
        * From (1), if Y is True then N is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, the Hamden Plaza Subway store has not received many negative reviews (N = True).

    In both cases, we find that the Hamden Plaza Subway store does not receive many negative reviews (N = True).

    If a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is a good guy. (M → G)
    The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is named after Sir Digby. (Given)
    In superhero movies, the good guys always win. (M → ¬S)
    The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is a superhero movie. (Given)
    Good guys fight bad guys and vice versa. (G → F)
    Sir Digby fights his nemesis. (Given)
    If somebody wins a fight, the person they are fighting does not win. (F → ¬S ∧ ¬G)

Logical Chain:
    From (1) and (2), we know G is True.
    From (3) and (4), we know ¬S is True.
    From (5) and (6), we know F is True.
    From (7), if F is True, then ¬S ∧ ¬G must be True. Since G is True, ¬S must be True.

Let:
    B: Walden contains knowledge
    R: Harry read Walden
    K: Harry gained knowledge
    S: Harry is smarter

Premises:
    Books contain tons of knowledge (All books contain knowledge)
    When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge (If R then K)
    If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter (If K then S)
    Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau (R = True)

Logical Chain:
    From (4), we know R = True
    From (2), if R = True then K = True, so K = True
    From (3), if K = True then S = True, so S = True

Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    Walden contains knowledge (B)

Logical Chain for Conclusion:
    Premise 1 states that "Books contain tons of knowledge," which is a general statement about all books. 
    It doesn't specifically state that Walden contains knowledge.
    While Harry reading Walden (R = True) led to him gaining knowledge (K = True), this doesn't directly prove that Walden itself contains knowledge.
    It's possible that Harry gained knowledge from other sources.

Therefore, the conclusion (B) is uncertain.

62 out of 93 is correct!
Let:
    O: Tom is allowed to move into The Olive Garden with Fluffy
    P: Pets are allowed in The Olive Garden
    D: The security deposit at The Olive Garden is no more than $1500
    C: Fluffy is a cat
    T: Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden
    
Premises:
    Pets are allowed in some managed buildings. (This doesn't guarantee pets are allowed at The Olive Garden)
    A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building. (True for The Olive Garden)
    The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more. (True for The Olive Garden)
    Fluffy is Tom's cat. (C = True)
    Cats are pets. (If C is True, then Fluffy is a pet)
    The Olive Garden is a managed building. (True)
    The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000. (True)
    $2000 is more than $1500. (True)
    Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500. (T → (P ∧ D))
    If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. (P → O)
Logical chain:
    From (6) C = True
    From (5) If C is True, then Fluffy is a pet.
    From (7) The Olive Garden is a managed building.
    From (8) The monthly rent at The Olive Garden is $2000.
    From (9) The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent or more.
    From (8) and (9), we know the security deposit is $2000.
    From (10), if the Olive Garden allows pets, then Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy (O = True).
    From (6) and (5), Fluffy is a pet.
    From (7), The Olive Garden is a managed building.
    From (8) The security deposit is $2000, which is more than $1500.
    From (9) Tom will rent an apartment in the Olive Garden if pets are allowed and the deposit is no more than $1500. 
    Since the deposit is more than $1500, Tom will not rent in this scenario.

    Therefore, O = False.

Let:
    H: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity

    C: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a company
    P: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company
    L: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law
    O: The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations

Premises:
    All business organizations are legal entities. (B → H)
    All companies are business organizations. (C → B)
    All private companies are companies. (P → C)
    All legal entities are created under law. (H → L)
    All legal entities have legal obligations. (H → O)
    If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. (L → ¬P)

Conclusion to Evaluate:
    The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations (O)

Logical Chain:

1. From (4) H → L, we know if H is True, then L must be True.
2. From (5) H → O, we know if H is True, then O must be True.
3. From (1) B → H, if B is True, then H must be True.
4. From (2) C → B, if C is True, then B must be True.
5. From (3) P → C, if P is True, then C must be True.
6. From (6) L → ¬P, if L is True, then P must be False.

Since we don't have enough information to definitively determine if H, B, C, or P are True or False, we cannot definitively conclude whether O is True or False.

65 out of 97 is correct!
Let:
    H: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company
    L: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law
    O: The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations
Premises:
    All business organizations are legal entities.
    All companies are business organizations.
    All private companies are companies.
    All legal entities are created under law.
    All legal entities have legal obligations.
    If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. (L → ¬H)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law, which translates to H → (O ∨ L).
Logical Chain:
    From (4) and (5), we know that if something is a legal entity, it has legal obligations (O) and is created under law (L).
    From (1), (2), and (3), we know that if something is a private company (H), it is a legal entity.
    Therefore, if something is a private company, it must have legal obligations (O) and is created under law (L).
    This means H → (O ∨ L) is always true.

Let:
    V: Harry is a vertebrate
    A: Harry is an animal
    I: Harry is an invertebrate
    Q: Harry is a queen bee
    M: Harry reproduces by male-and-female mating
Premises:
    All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates (A → (I ∨ V))
    All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating (V → M)
    All vertebrate animals have a backbone (V → V)
    All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating (B → ¬M)
    All queen bees are bees (Q → B)
    Harry is a bee (B = True)
Logical chain:
    From (6), B = True.
    From (5), B = True → Q = True, therefore Q = True
    From (4), B = True → ¬M, therefore ¬M = True
    From (2), V → M, and M is False, therefore V must be False
    From (1), A → (I ∨ V), and V is False, therefore I must be True
    Therefore, Harry is an invertebrate (I = True) and a queen bee (Q = True)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    ( (V ∧ V) ∨ (¬V ∧ ¬V) ) → (¬I ∧ ¬Q)
    This simplifies to (V ∧ V) ∨ (¬V ∧ ¬V) → (¬I ∧ ¬Q)
    Since we know V = False and I = True, Q = True, the conclusion becomes:
    (False ∧ False) ∨ (True ∧ True) → (False ∧ False)
    This simplifies to True → False, which is False.

Let:
    M: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth
    S: Luke has siblings who were born together
    A: Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings
    H: Luke lives at home
    St: Luke lives with strangers
Premises:
    M ∧ St → A  (People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings)
    S → M (If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth)
    A → H (If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home)
    H → ¬St (If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers)
    Luke is either a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. (This is the key premise that defines the possibilities for Luke)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know either M ∧ St or ¬M ∧ ¬St must be true.
    Let's analyze each case:
    * **Case 1: M ∧ St**
        * If M ∧ St is true, then from (1), A must be true.
        * From (4), if A is true, then H must be true.
        * From (4), if H is true, then St must be false.
        * This leads to a contradiction with the initial assumption M ∧ St.
    * **Case 2: ¬M ∧ ¬St**
        * If ¬M ∧ ¬St is true, then from (4), H must be false.
        * From (3), if H is false, then A cannot be true.

Therefore, the premise (5) leads to a contradiction, meaning the conclusion (A) is false.

    Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers (M ∧ St) ∨ (¬M ∧ ¬St)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know either (M ∧ St) or (¬M ∧ ¬St) is true.

    Let's analyze each case:

    * **Case 1: (M ∧ St)**
        * If M is True, then from (2), S must also be True.
        * From (1), if M and S are True, then H must be True.
        * From (4), if H is True, then St must be False (contradiction).
        * Therefore, this case is impossible.

    * **Case 2: (¬M ∧ ¬St)**
        * If M is False, then from (2), S must be False.
        * From (3), if A is True, then S must be True (contradiction).
        * Therefore, A must be False.
        * From (5), if H is True, then A must be True (contradiction).
        * Therefore, H must be False.
        * From (4), if H is False, then St must be True.

    * **Conclusion:**
        * In the only possible case, Luke is not born in a multiple birth (¬M) and does not complain often about annoying siblings (¬A).

Let:
    S: Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing
    C: Peter is cleanly
    T: Peter is notably tidy
    O: Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness
    F: Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try

Premises:
    If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy. (S → ¬T)
    All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. (F → S)
    If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy. (C → T)
    If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly. (O → C)
    All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness. (O → O)
    Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. (S ∧ C) ∨ (¬S ∧ ¬C)

Logical Chain:
    We need to analyze the given premises to see if we can derive a definite conclusion about T (Peter is notably tidy).
    
    * **Premise 1** states that if someone spills a lot, they are not notably tidy (S → ¬T).
    * **Premise 2** states that clumsy foodies who go out frequently spill a lot (F → S).
    * **Premise 3** states that if someone is cleanly, they are notably tidy (C → T).
    * **Premise 4** states that if someone values order and spotlessness, they are cleanly (O → C).
    * **Premise 5** states that if a family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then the person values it too (O → O).
    * **Premise 6** presents two possibilities for Peter: either he spills a lot and is cleanly, or he doesn't spill a lot and isn't cleanly.

    Since we don't have enough information to definitively determine whether Peter spills a lot (S) or is cleanly (C), we cannot definitively conclude whether Peter is notably tidy (T).

    Let's analyze each possibility:
    * **Case 1: S ∧ C**
        * If S is True, then from (1), T is False.
        * From (2), if F is True then S is True.

    From (2), if F is True then S is True.
    From (1), if S is True then T is False.
    From (3), if C is True then T is True.
    Therefore, if F is True, then C must be False.

Let:

    W: An item is an object of worship
Premises:
    All fir trees are evergreens (F → E)
    Some objects of worship are fir trees (∃x W ∧ F)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    Some evergreens are not objects of worship, which translates to ¬(All evergreens are objects of worship) or ¬(E → W)

Logical Chain:

1. **Premise 1 (F → E):**  If something is a fir tree, it is an evergreen. This doesn't say anything about whether all evergreens are fir trees.

2. **Premise 2 (∃x W ∧ F):** There exists at least one thing that is both a fir tree and an object of worship.

3. **Conclusion to Evaluate (¬(E → W)):** We need to show that there exists at least one evergreen that is *not* an object of worship. 

4. **Logical Chain:**  Since we know there exists at least one fir tree that is an object of worship, it's possible that there are other evergreens (not necessarily fir trees) that are not objects of worship.  We don't have enough information to definitively say whether this is true or false.

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):

| F (Fir Tree) | E (Evergreen) | W (Object of Worship) | E → W (All evergreens are objects of worship) | ¬(E → W) (Some evergreens are not objects of worship) |

2. **Premise 2 (∃x W ∧ F):** There exists at least one thing that is both a fir tree and an object of worship.

3. **Conclusion to Evaluate (¬(E → W)):** We need to show that there exists at least one evergreen that is *not* an object of worship. 

4. **Logical Chain:**  Since we know there exists at least one fir tree that is an object of worship, it's possible that there are other evergreens (not necessarily fir trees) that are not objects of worship.  We don't have enough information to definitively say whether this is true or false.

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):

| F (Fir Tree) | E (Evergreen) | W (Object of Worship) | E → W (All evergreens are objects of worship) | ¬(E → W) (Some evergreens are not objects of worship) |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| True          | True         | True               | True                                   | False                                        |
| True          | True         | False              | False                                  | True                                         |
| False         | True         | True               | True                                   | False                                        |
| False         | True         | False              | False                                  | True                                         |

Since we can't definitively say whether all evergreens are objects of worship, the conclusion is uncertain.

    If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters. (M → ¬O)
    All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers. (T → M)
    All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters. (S → O)
    All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. (This premise is irrelevant to the conclusion)
    If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. (¬T → ¬(T ∨ S))

Logical Chain:
    From (2), if T is True then M is True.
    From (1), if M is True then O is False.
    Therefore, if T is True, then O is False.
    From (3), if S is True then O is True.
    From (5), if ¬T is True then ¬(T ∨ S) is True, meaning ¬T and ¬S must both be True.

    From (4), if O is True, then S is True.
    From (5), if ¬T is True, then ¬T and ¬S must both be True.
    We need to analyze the possibilities:
    * **Case 1: T is True**
        * From (2), Multi-passenger is True.
        * From (1), if Multi-passenger is True, then ¬One-seater must be True.

    From (8), Rock can fly (F) or is a bird (B) or cannot breathe.
    We need to consider all possibilities:

    * **Case 1: Rock can fly (F)**
        * From (6), if F is True, then W is True.
    * **Case 2: Rock is a bird (B)**
        * From (3), if Rock is a bird, then it is a pet.
        * From (4), all birds that are Peter's pets can fly, so F is True.
        * From (6), if F is True, then W is True.
    * **Case 3: Rock cannot breathe** 
        * This case doesn't directly lead to a conclusion about wings.

    Since in both possible cases where Rock is a pet, Rock either flies or is a bird, and if Rock flies, it has wings, we can conclude that Rock has wings.

Let:
    M: Rock is a mammal
    B: Rock is a bird
    A: Rock is an animal
    F: Rock can fly
    W: Rock has wings
Premises:
    All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals. (If Rock is a mammal, then Rock is an animal)
    All monkeys are mammals.
    Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.
    Peter's birds can fly.
    All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
    If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
    Rock is Peter's pet.
    Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Rock has wings (W)

Logical Chain:
    From (6), if Rock can fly (F), then Rock has wings (W).
    From (7), Rock is Peter's pet.
    From (8), Rock can fly (F) or is a bird (B) or cannot breathe.

Let:
    M: Rock is a mammal
    A: Rock is an animal
    B: Rock is a bird
    F: Rock can fly
    W: Rock has wings
    P: Rock is Peter's pet

Premises:
    All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals. (M ∧ P → A)
    All monkeys are mammals. (M → A)
    Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. (P → (M ∨ B))
    Peter's birds can fly. (B → F)
    All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe. (A ∧ P → B)
    If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings. (F → W)
    Rock is Peter's pet. (P is True)
    Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. (F ∨ B ∨ ¬A)

Logical chain:

1. **From (7), we know P = True.**

2. **From (7), we know F ∨ B ∨ ¬A must be true.**

3. **We need to analyze the possibilities:**
    * **If F is True:**
        * From (6), if F is True then W must be True.
        * This contradicts the conclusion (Rock does not have wings).
    * **If B is True:**
        * From (4), if B is True then F must be True.
        * From (6), if F is True then W must be True.
        * This contradicts the conclusion (Rock does not have wings).
    * **If ¬A is True:**
        * From (5), if A is False then B must be False.
        * This leaves us with F being the only possibility, leading to W being True (from 6).
        * This contradicts the conclusion (Rock does not have wings).

4. **Therefore, none of the possibilities for (7) lead to the conclusion being true.**

Let:
    E: John is engaged
    W: John makes wedding plans
    I: John invites others to their ceremony
    F: John has a larger family
    A: John's wedding is well-attended
Premises:
    All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged. (W → E)
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (I → W)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (A → I)
    Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families. (∃x(A(x) ∧ F(x)))
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬(I ∧ W))
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (F → (A ∨ I))
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    John has a larger family (F)

Logical Chain:
    We need to analyze the premises to see if we can definitively determine the truth value of F.
    
    Premise 5: (E → ¬(I ∧ W))  
    Premise 6: (F → (A ∨ I))
    
    These premises do not directly lead us to a conclusion about whether John has a larger family (F).
    
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
    We can construct a truth table to explore different possibilities, but it will be quite large due to the multiple variables. 
    
    Without a direct link between F and the other premises, it's impossible to determine the truth value of F.

Premises:

    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans (I → P)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony (W → I)

    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony (F → (W ∨ I))
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    John does not have a larger family, which translates to ¬F.

Logical Chain:
    The premises do not directly state that John does not have a larger family. 
    The premises establish relationships between engagement, wedding plans, invitations, and well-attended weddings, but they do not definitively rule out the possibility of John having a larger family.

Truth Table (Simplified):
    Since the premises do not directly address John's family size, we cannot determine the truth value of ¬F.

    I: John invites others to their ceremony
    W: John has a well-attended wedding
    L: John has a larger family
Premises:

    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (I → P)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (W → I)

    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (L → (W ∨ I))
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    John is engaged (E)

Logical Chain:

1. **Analyze the premises:**
   - The premises establish a chain of reasoning: 
     - If John makes wedding plans, he is engaged.
     - If John invites others, he makes wedding plans.
     - If John has a well-attended wedding, he invites others.
     - Some people with well-attended weddings have large families.
     - If John is engaged, he doesn't invite others or make plans.
     - If John has a large family, he either has a well-attended wedding or invites others.

2. **Look for contradictions:**
   - The premises do not directly state that John is engaged or not engaged. 
   - The premises create a complex web of possibilities, making it difficult to definitively conclude whether John is engaged.

3. **Consider all possibilities:**
   -  We can't determine John's engagement status with certainty based on the given information.

   - The premises create a complex web of possibilities, making it difficult to definitively conclude whether John is engaged.

3. **Consider all possibilities:**
   -  We can't determine John's engagement status with certainty based on the given information.

87 out of 130 is correct!
Let:
    E: John is engaged
    P: John makes wedding plans
    I: John invites others to his ceremony
    F: John has a larger family
    W: John has a well-attended wedding
Premises:
    All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged. (P → E)
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (I → P)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (W → I)
    Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families. (∃x(W(x) ∧ F(x)))
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬(I ∧ P))
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (F → (W ∨ I))
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding, which translates to ¬(F ∧ I)
Logical Chain:
    From (1) and (2), we can infer that I → P → E.
    From (5), if E is True, then I and P are False.
    From (6), if F is True, then either W or I is True.
    Therefore, if John is engaged, he cannot have a larger family and invite others to his ceremony.
    The conclusion ¬(F ∧ I) is true if John is engaged.
    However, we don't know for sure if John is engaged.

1. **Analyze the conclusion:**  We want to know if F ∨ Fr is true.

2. **Look for contradictions:**  The premises don't directly state that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive content or is in the "Frozen" series. They only state it's either one or the other, or both.

3. **Consider the possibilities:**

    * **Scenario 1: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film (FF is True):**
        * From (4), FF → G, so G is True
        * From (3), G → A, so A is True
        * From (2), A → ¬F, so F is False
        * This scenario satisfies the conclusion (F ∨ Fr)

    * **Scenario 2: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages (A is True):**
        * From (1), A → ¬F, so F is False
        * From (2), F → ¬A, so A is True
        * This scenario satisfies the conclusion (F ∨ Fr)

    * **Scenario 3: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is neither a family-friendly animated film nor appropriate for all ages:**
        * This scenario doesn't directly lead to a conclusion about F or Fr.

4. **Since we can't definitively determine if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for all ages, the conclusion remains uncertain.**

    P: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a film in the "Frozen" series
    C: Children can watch "Hachi: A dog's Tale" without guidance
Premises:
    If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents. (G → C)
    If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents. (F → ¬C)

    All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience. (A → G)
    All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films. (P → A)
    "Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film. (This premise is redundant for the conclusion)
    "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. (A ∨ G)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    "Hachi: A dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series. (F ∧ P ∨ ¬F ∧ ¬P)

Logical Chain:
    From (5) and (6), if P is True, then A is True, and from (4) if A is True then G is True.
    From (1) and (2), if G is True then C is True, and if F is True then C is False.
    From (7), either A or G must be True.

    We need to analyze the possibilities:
    * **Case 1: A is True**
        * If A is True, then from (4) G is True, and from (1) C is True.
        * This case does not lead to the conclusion because it doesn't force F to be True.
    * **Case 2: G is True**
        * If G is True, then from (1) C is True.
        * This case also doesn't force F to be True.
    * **Case 3: F is True**
        * If F is True, then from (2) C is False.
        * This case doesn't force P to be True.
    * **Case 4: ¬F and ¬P**
        * This case directly leads to the conclusion.

Therefore, the conclusion is true.

Premises:
    B is True (Given)
    A is True (Given)
    E is True (Given)
    S is True (Given)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    H

Logical Chain:
    From the premise "Breeding back is a form of artificial selection" (B), we know that if breeding back is used, then the result is artificially selected.

Logical Chain:
    The premises do not explicitly state that aurochs are extinct.
    While breeding back involves resembling extinct animals (S), this does not automatically mean the original animal is extinct.
    Heck cattle resemble aurochs (H), but this doesn't imply aurochs themselves are extinct.

    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom. (¬T ∧ ¬G)
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official. (U ∨ R)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or is a manager at Gazprom, which translates to P ∨ G.
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know either U or R must be True.
    If U is True:

    If R is True:
        From (4), C must be False.

Let:
    U: Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States
    T: Ekaterina has United States citizenship
    C: Ekaterina has Taiwanese citizenship
    R: Ekaterina is a Russian Federation official
    G: Ekaterina is a manager at Gazprom
Premises:
    If Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, then she can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election. (U → P)
    If Ekaterina has United States citizenship, then she can register to vote in the United States. (T → U)
    A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship. (T ∨ C)
    No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship. (¬R → ¬C)
    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom. (¬T ∧ ¬G)
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official. (U ∨ R)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or is a manager at Gazprom, which translates to P ∨ G.
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know either U or R must be True.
    If U is True:
        From (1), P is True.
    If R is True:
        From (4), C must be False.
        From (5), T must be False.
        Therefore, G must be False.
    Thus, in both cases, either P or G is True.

Truth Table (Simplified):
| U (Register to Vote) | T (US Citizenship) | C (Taiwanese Citizenship) | R (Russian Official) | G (Manager at Gazprom) | P (Can Participate in Election) | P ∨ G (Can Participate or is Manager) |

Let:
    U: Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States
    T: Ekaterina has United States citizenship
    R: Ekaterina is a Russian federation official
    V: Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom
    C: Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election
    
Premises:
    If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States. (T → U)
    Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election. (U → C)
    A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship. (T ∨ ¬T)
    No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship. (¬R ∧ ¬T)
    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom. (¬T ∧ ¬V)
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official. (U ∨ R)

Logical Chain:
    From (5) ¬T ∧ ¬V is True.
    From (6) U ∨ R is True.

    We need to analyze the possibilities:

    * **Case 1: U is True**
        * From (1) and (2), if U is True then C is True.
        * The conclusion (C ∨ V) is True.

    * **Case 2: R is True**
        * From (4), if R is True then ¬T is True.
        * From (5), if ¬T is True then ¬V is True.
        * The conclusion (C ∨ V) is True.

    * **Case 3: Both U and R are False**
        * This case is impossible because (6) states that either U or R must be True.

    Therefore, in all possible scenarios, the conclusion (C ∨ V) is True.

97 out of 148 is correct!
Let:
    E: Ekaterina can register to vote in the US
    V: Vladimir can participate in the 2024 US presidential election
    U: Ekaterina has US citizenship
    T: Vladimir has Taiwanese citizenship
    R: Vladimir is a Russian Federation official

Premises:
    If someone can register to vote in the US, they can participate in the 2024 US presidential election. (E → V)
    If someone has US citizenship, they can register to vote in the US. (U → E)
    A person either has US citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship. (U ∨ T)
    No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship. (¬R ∧ ¬T)
    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is a manager at Gazprom. (¬T ∧ ¬R)
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official. (E ∨ R)

Logical Chain:

1. **Analyze the conclusion:** The conclusion states "It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election," which translates to ¬(E ∧ V).
2. **Work backward from the conclusion:**  
    - ¬(E ∧ V)  means either E is False or V is False, or both. 
3. **Examine the premises:**
    - We need to find a scenario where either E or V is False.
    - Let's consider the case where E is False:
        - If E is False, then from (5) Ekaterina must be a Russian Federation official (R = True)
        - From (4), if R is True, then T must be False.
        - From (2), if U is True, then E must be True, so U must be False.
        - From (3), if U is False, then T must be True.
        - From (4), if T is True, then R must be False, which contradicts our earlier finding that R = True.
    - Therefore, E must be True.
    - This means V must be False.

4. **Conclusion:**
    - Since V is False, the statement ¬(E ∧ V) is True.

    H: The mixture is a hydrocarbon
    A: The mixture is an alkane
    O: The mixture is an organic compound
    Ch: The mixture is a chemical compound
    E: The mixture contains only one element

Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds (H → O)
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons (A → H)
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds (O → Ch)
    All organic compounds contain carbon (O → C)
    No chemical compounds contain only one element (Ch → ¬E)
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. (Ch ∧ E) ∨ (¬Ch ∧ ¬E)

Logical Chain:
    From (5), if Ch is True, then E must be False.
    From (6), we know either (Ch ∧ E) or (¬Ch ∧ ¬E) must be True.
    If (Ch ∧ E) were True, then from (5), it would be a contradiction. 
    Therefore, (¬Ch ∧ ¬E) must be True.
    From (4), if O is True, then C is True.
    From (3), if O is True, then Ch is True.
    From (2), if A is True, then H is True.
    From (1), if H is True, then O is True.

    Therefore, if the mixture is not a chemical compound or does not contain only one element, then it is an alkane, a hydrocarbon, and an organic compound, all of which contain carbon.

Truth Table (Simplified):
| Ch (Chemical Compound) | E (Contains Only One Element) | H (Hydrocarbon) | A (Alkane) | O (Organic Compound) | C (Contains Carbon) |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| False                  | True                         | False          | False    | False          | False          |

Let:
    H: The mixture is a hydrocarbon
    A: The mixture is an alkane
    O: The mixture is an organic compound
    C: The mixture contains carbon
    E: The mixture contains only one element

Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds (H → O)
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons (A → H)
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds (O → C)
    All organic compounds contain carbon (O → C)
    No chemical compounds contain only one element (¬E → ¬C)
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. (E ∨ ¬(E ∧ C))

Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon, which translates to A ∧ C.

Logical Chain:
    From (1) and (2), if A is True, then H is True, and from (3), if H is True, then O is True.
    From (4), if O is True, then C is True.
    Therefore, if A is True, then A ∧ C is True.
    However, from (5), if E is True, then C is False. 
    From (6), E ∨ ¬(E ∧ C) is True. This means either E is True or ¬(E ∧ C) is True.
    If E is True, then from (5), C is False, so A ∧ C would be False.
    Therefore, ¬(E ∧ C) must be True. This means E is False and C is True.

100 out of 154 is correct!
Let:
    C: The mixture contains carbon
    E: The mixture contains only one element
    O: The mixture is an organic compound
    H: The mixture is a hydrocarbon
    Ch: The mixture is a chemical compound
    A: The mixture is an alkane
Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds (H → O)
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons (A → H)
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds (O → Ch)
    All organic compounds contain carbon (O → C)
    No chemical compounds contain only one element (Ch → ¬E)
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither ( (Ch ∧ E) ∨ ¬(Ch ∧ E))
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane, which translates to (E ∨ C) → (¬Ch ∧ ¬A)

Logical Chain:
    From (4) and (3), we know that if the mixture is an organic compound, it contains carbon (O → C).
    From (5), we know that if the mixture is a chemical compound, it does not contain only one element (Ch → ¬E).
    The conclusion states that if the mixture contains only one element (E) or contains carbon (C), then it is neither a chemical compound (¬Ch) nor an alkane (¬A).
    We need to analyze the cases where (E ∨ C) is True:
    * **Case 1: E is True:** 
        * If E is True, then from (5), Ch must be False. 
        * Therefore, the conclusion holds.
    * **Case 2: C is True:**
        * If C is True, then from (4) and (3), O must be True.
        * From (3), if O is True, then Ch must be True.
        * However, the conclusion states ¬Ch, so this case contradicts the conclusion.
    * **Case 3: Both E and C are True:**
        * This case is a contradiction as E and C cannot both be True simultaneously (from premise 5).

Truth Table (Simplified):

    Therefore, PartTime = False

Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    ¬PartTime 

Logical Chain:
    We have derived that PartTime = False.
    Therefore, ¬PartTime = True.

Let:
    CS: James is from the computer science department
    Library: James works in the library
    PartTime: James has a part-time job offered by the university
    Database: James is taking the database course
    David: James is taking a class with Professor David

    All(PartTime) → Library 
    All(Database) → CS
    All(David) → Database
    All(Lab) → David
    James is a student working in the lab (Lab = True)
    ¬(Lab ∧ PartTime) 

Logical Chain:
    From (6), Lab = True
    From (5), Lab = True → David = True, therefore David = True
    From (4), David = True → Database = True, therefore Database = True
    From (3), Database = True → CS = True, therefore CS = True
    From (1), ¬(Library ∧ CS) is True, so either Library is False or CS is False. 
    We know CS is True, therefore Library must be False.
    From (2), All(PartTime) → Library, and since Library is False, PartTime must be False.
    Therefore, James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.
    
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    James either takes the database course or has a part-time job offered by the university (Database ∨ PartTime)
    Since Database is True and PartTime is False, the conclusion is True.

    C_o: George composes
Premises:
    If George likes music, he wants to compose. (L → W)
    If George has access to a program, he can compose. (P → C)
    If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose. (C ∧ W → C_o)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose, which translates to (L ∧ P → C_o)
Logical Chain:
    From (1), if L is True, then W is True.
    From (2), if P is True, then C is True.
    From (3), if C is True and W is True, then C_o is True.
    Therefore, if both L and P are True, then C_o is True.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| L (Likes Music) | P (Access to Program) | C (Can Compose) | W (Wants to Compose) | C_o (Composes) |

Let:
    M: George likes music
    C: George can compose
    W: George wants to compose
    C: George will compose

Premises:
    If George likes music, he wants to compose. (M → W)
    If George has access to a program, he can compose. (P → C) 
    If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose. (C ∧ W → C)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    If George will not compose, George can not compose. (¬C → ¬C)

Logical Chain:
    The conclusion states that if George will not compose (¬C), then he cannot compose (¬C). This is a tautology; if something will not happen, it cannot happen. 
    Therefore, the statement is always true, regardless of the truth value of the premises.

    Heinrich Schmidt was also a member of the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag. (Implied: G = True, but does not directly state R)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian or both (G ∨ R)

Logical Chain:
    From the first premise, we know G = True.
    The second premise does not provide information to determine R.
    Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain as we cannot definitively say if R is True or False.

Let:
    S: Taylor eats salads regularly
    H: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home
    G: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day
    D: Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes
    P: Taylor is very conscious about her health and eating habits
    R: Taylor disregards her physical well-being
Premises:
    S → P (All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits)
    H → S (All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly)
    D → H (All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes)
    ¬R → ¬P (All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits)
    G → D (If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes)
    H ∨ ¬(H ∧ R) (Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither)

Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know either H is True and R is True, or H is False and R is False.

    Let's analyze each case:

    * **Case 1: H is True and R is True**
        * From (2), if H is True, then S is True.
        * From (1), if S is True, then P is True.
        * From (4), if R is True, then ¬P is True.
        * This leads to a contradiction (P and ¬P are both True). So, this case is impossible.

    * **Case 2: H is False and R is False**
        * From (3), if D is True, then H is True.
        * From (5), if G is True, then D is True.
        * Therefore, if G is True, then H is True, which contradicts our initial assumption that H is False. So, G must be False.

    Conclusion:
    Since G must be False, Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day.

    The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo. (Given as True)
    The United States won the most medals in Tokyo. (Given as True)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    The world championships is a sporting event (S)

Logical Chain:
    The premises do not provide any information about the world championships. 
    They only state facts about the Summer Olympic Games.
    Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of S based on the given premises.

116 out of 180 is correct!
Let:
    S: Susan flies to LGA
    J: John flies to LGA
    D: Departure is at LGA
    A: Arrival is at LGA

Premises:
    S is True
    D ≠ A 
    John flies from LGA (This implies D = LGA)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    J is True

Logical Chain:
    From the premises, we know D = LGA.
    From the premise D ≠ A, we know A ≠ LGA.
    Therefore, John cannot fly to LGA (J = False).

Let:

Premises:
    ¬(N ∧ M)  (No one nice to animals is also mean to animals)
    ∃x(G ∧ M) (Some grumpy people are mean to animals)
    A → N (All animal lovers are nice to animals)
    P → A (All pet owners love animals)
    P is True (Tom is a pet owner)

Logical chain:

1. **From (5), P = True**
2. **From (4), P = True → A = True, so A = True**
3. **From (3), A = True → N = True, so N = True**
4. **From (1), ¬(N ∧ M), we know that if N is True, then M must be False**
5. **Therefore, M = False**
6. **The conclusion states: ¬(G ∧ M) → (¬G ∧ ¬A)**
7. **We know M = False, so ¬(G ∧ M) is True**
8. **To evaluate the implication, we need to check if ¬G ∧ ¬A is True**
9. **We know A = True, so ¬A = False**
10. **Therefore, ¬G ∧ ¬A is False**
11. **Since the conclusion is an implication, it is only false if the antecedent is True and the consequent is False.**
12. **We have ¬(G ∧ M) = True and ¬G ∧ ¬A = False**

121 out of 185 is correct!
Let:
    P: Family Secrets is a novel
    A: Dani Shapiro is American
    N: A podcast is a novel
    W: Dani Shapiro is a novel writer
    B: Family History is a novel
    F: Family History is written by Dani Shapiro
    C: Boston is an American city

Premises:
    ¬(P ∧ ¬N)  (A podcast is not a novel)
    (A ∧ B) → A (If a person is born in American City, the person is American)
    (N ∧ F) → W (If a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer)
    A is True (Dani Shapiro is an American)
    B is True (Family History is a novel)
    F is True (Family History is written by Dani Shapiro)
    C is True (Boston is an American city)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    P (Family Secrets is a novel)

Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know A is True.
    From (6), we know B is True.
    From (7), we know F is True.
    From (3), if B and F are True, then W is True.
    However, this does not directly imply anything about P (Family Secrets).

    The premises do not provide any information linking Dani Shapiro's novel writing (W) to her podcast (P).

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| A (Dani Shapiro is American) | B (Family History is a novel) | F (Family History is written by Dani Shapiro) | W (Dani Shapiro is a novel writer) | P (Family Secrets is a novel) |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| True                         | True                         | True                             | True                             | True or False                |
| True                         | True                         | True                             | True                             | True or False                |

Since the premises do not establish a direct link between Family History and Family Secrets, the truth value of P remains uncertain.

    F: Family History is written by Dani Shapiro
    C: Boston is an American city

Premises:
    ¬(P ∧ ¬N)  (A podcast is not a novel)
    (A ∧ B) → A (If a person is born in American City, the person is American)
    (N ∧ F) → W (If a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer)
    A is True (Dani Shapiro is an American)
    B is True (Family History is a novel)
    F is True (Family History is written by Dani Shapiro)
    C is True (Boston is an American city)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    P (Family Secrets is a novel)

Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know A is True.
    From (6), we know B is True.
    From (7), we know F is True.
    From (3), if B and F are True, then W is True.
    However, this does not directly imply anything about P (Family Secrets).

    The premises do not provide any information linking Dani Shapiro's novel writing (W) to her podcast (P).

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| A (Dani Shapiro is American) | B (Family History is a novel) | F (Family History is written by Dani Shapiro) | W (Dani Shapiro is a novel writer) | P (Family Secrets is a novel) |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| True                         | True                         | True                             | True                             | True or False                |
| True                         | True                         | True                             | True                             | True or False                |
| True                         | True                         | True                             | True                             | True or False                |

Since the premises do not establish a direct link between Family History and Family Secrets, the truth value of P remains uncertain.

    If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (S → L)
    If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L → M)
    Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (¬M)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, which translates to ¬P.
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know ¬M is True.
    From (3), if L were True, then M would be True, so L must be False.
    From (2), if J were True, then S would be True, and from (3), if S were True, then L would be True. Therefore, J must be False.
    From (1), we know that some J ∧ ¬A is True, but we don't know if Yuri is one of them.

    From (3), if L were True, then A would be True, so L must be False.
    From (2), if J were True, then L would be True, so J must be False.
    From (1), we know that some professional basketball players are not American nationals, so we can't definitively say that all professional basketball players are American nationals.
    Therefore, from (2), (3), and (5), we know P must be False.

Let:
    P: Yuri is an American professional basketball player
    A: Yuri activates his leg muscles
    L: Yuri leaps straight into the air
    J: Yuri can do jump shots
Premises:
    Some professional basketball players are not American nationals. (Does not directly help us determine Yuri's status)
    All professional basketball players can do jump shots. (J → P)
    If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (J → L)
    If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L → A)
    Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (A is False)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player, which translates to ¬L → P.
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know A is False.
    From (3), if L were True, then A would be True, so L must be False.
    From (2), if J were True, then L would be True, so J must be False.
    From (1), we know that some professional basketball players are not American nationals, so we can't definitively say that all professional basketball players are American nationals.
    Therefore, from (2), (3), and (5), we know P must be False.

Let:
    A: Yuri is an American professional basketball player
    P: Yuri is a professional basketball player
    J: Yuri can do jump shots
    L: Yuri leaps straight into the air
    M: Yuri activates his leg muscles
Premises:
    Some professional basketball players are not American nationals. (∃x(P(x) ∧ ¬A(x)))
    All professional basketball players can do jump shots. (∀x(P(x) → J(x)))
    If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (∀x(J(x) → L(x)))
    If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (∀x(L(x) → M(x)))
    Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (¬M(x))
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know ¬M(x)
    From (4), if L(x) were True, then M(x) would be True, so L(x) must be False.
    From (3), if J(x) were True, then L(x) would be True, so J(x) must be False.
    From (2), if P(x) were True, then J(x) would be True, so P(x) must be False.
    Therefore, Yuri is not a professional basketball player (¬P(x)).
    The conclusion states that "If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player," which translates to ¬A(x) → P(x). 
    Since we know P(x) is False, the implication ¬A(x) → P(x) is vacuously true.

Let:
    H: An event is happy
    S: An event is sad
Premises:
    All events are either happy or sad (H ∨ S)
    At least one event is happy (There exists an event that is happy)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    All events are sad (S ∧ S ∧ ... ∧ S) which simplifies to S
Logical Chain:
    Premise 1 (H ∨ S) tells us that every event must be either happy or sad.
    Premise 2 (There exists an event that is happy) tells us at least one event is happy.
    Therefore, it's impossible for *all* events to be sad. 
Truth Table:
    Since we know at least one event is happy, it's impossible for all events to be sad.

The final answer is (B).

Let:

    B: KiKi barks
    J: KiKi jumps
    L: KiKi has legs
    T: KiKi is terricolous

Premises:
    ¬(Jane likes D ∧ B)  
    All D are animals that bark (All D → (B))
    Jane likes all animals that jump (All J → (Jane likes J))
    If an animal has legs, then it jumps (L → J)
    If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs (T → L)
    KiKi is an animal (KiKi is an animal)
    ¬(¬J ∧ ¬L) → (T ∨ L)  

Logical Chain:
    From (6) KiKi is an animal.
    We need to determine if KiKi is both a dog (D) and barks (B).

    Let's analyze the premises:
    - (1) ¬(Jane likes D ∧ B): Jane does not like any animals that bark and are dogs.
    - (2) All D are animals that bark (All D → (B)): If KiKi is a dog, then it barks.
    - (3) Jane likes all animals that jump (All J → (Jane likes J)): If KiKi jumps, then Jane likes it.
    - (4) If an animal has legs, then it jumps (L → J): If KiKi has legs, then it jumps.
    - (5) If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs (T → L): If KiKi is terricolous, then it has legs.
    - (6) KiKi is an animal: This is given.
    - (7) ¬(¬J ∧ ¬L) → (T ∨ L): If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then it is terricolous or has legs.

    We need to see if we can deduce D and B from these premises. 

    - We can't definitively say if KiKi is a dog (D) or barks (B) based on the given premises.

Let:
    D: KiKi is a dog
    B: KiKi barks
    J: KiKi jumps
    L: KiKi has legs
    T: KiKi is terricolous

Premises:
    ¬(Jane likes D) (Jane does not like any animals that bark)
    All dogs are animals that bark (D → B)
    Jane likes all animals that jump (J → (Jane likes KiKi))
    If an animal has legs, then it jumps (L → J)
    If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs (T → L)
    KiKi is an animal (KiKi is an animal)
    ¬(¬J ∧ ¬L) → (T ∨ L) (If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs)

Logical chain:
    From (5), if T is True, then L is True.
    From (4), if L is True, then J is True.
    Therefore, if T is True, then J is True.
    From (2), if D is True, then B is True.
    From (1), if B is True, then Jane does not like KiKi.
    From (3), if J is True, then Jane likes KiKi.
    Therefore, if D is True, then Jane does not like KiKi, which contradicts (3).
    Therefore, D must be False.
    Since D is False, B is also False.
    Therefore, KiKi does not bark.

    If an animal has legs, then it jumps (L → J)
    If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs (T → L)
    KiKi is an animal (KiKi is an animal)
    ¬(¬J ∧ ¬L) → (T ∨ L) (If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs)

Logical chain:
    From (5), if T is True, then L is True.
    From (4), if L is True, then J is True.
    Therefore, if T is True, then J is True.
    From (2), if D is True, then B is True.
    From (1), if B is True, then Jane does not like KiKi.
    From (3), if J is True, then Jane likes KiKi.
    Therefore, if D is True, then Jane does not like KiKi, which contradicts (3).
    Therefore, D must be False.
    Since D is False, B is also False.
    Therefore, KiKi does not bark.

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| D (KiKi is a dog) | B (KiKi barks) | J (KiKi jumps) | L (KiKi has legs) | T (KiKi is terricolous) |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------|
| False             | False        | True          | True          | True               |
