4 out of 8 is correct!

1. **Premise 1:** When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.
2. **Premise 2:** Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.
3. **Premise 3:** Humans are mammals.
4. **Premise 4:** Mammals are animals.
5. **Premise 5:** Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
6. **Premise 6:** People feel tired when they get the flu.

We are trying to determine if **coughing** is a symptom of Monkeypox.  

* The premises provide information about Monkeypox and its symptoms (fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness), but they do not mention coughing as a symptom.
* The premises also state that the flu causes tiredness, but this does not imply that Monkeypox causes coughing.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude whether or not coughing is a symptom of Monkeypox.

6 out of 10 is correct!
<nl_cot>
1. **Premise:** There are six types of wild turkeys: Eastern wild turkey, Osceola wild turkey, Gould’s wild turkey, Merriam’s wild turkey, Rio Grande wild turkey, and Ocellated wild turkey.
2. **Premise:** Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey.
3. **Premise:** Tom is not an Osceola wild turkey.
4. **Premise:** Tom is not a Gould's wild turkey.
5. **Premise:** Tom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey.
6. **Premise:** Tom is a wild turkey.

We can combine premises 2-5 to conclude that Tom is not any of the first five types of wild turkeys. 

7. Since Tom is a wild turkey (premise 6) and not any of the first five types, the only remaining possibility is that Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey.

Therefore, the conclusion "Tom is an Eastern wild turkey" is false. </nl_cot>

1. **Premise 1:** All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
2. **Premise 2:** Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
3. **Premise 3:** The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
4. **Premise 4:** If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
5. **Premise 5:** All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
6. **Premise 6:** Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.

Now we need to analyze the conclusion: "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish."

* **If Rockie is not a turtle and not a squirrel**, then according to Premise 3, Rockie must be a rabbit.
* **Since Rockie is a rabbit and Premise 1 states that all rabbits spotted near the campus are cute**, Rockie must be cute.

Therefore, if Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is cute. 

The conclusion is true.

16 out of 26 is correct!
<nl_cot>
The premises provide information about Beijing's status as the capital of China, its population, location, and hosting of major events.  They also mention its prestigious universities. 

However, none of the premises state or imply anything about the size of Beijing relative to other Chinese cities.  

Therefore, we cannot determine if Beijing is the second largest Chinese city based on the given information.

<nl_cot>
The conclusion states that Robert Lewandowski is a star. 

The premises tell us that he is a striker, strikers are soccer players, he left Bayern Munchen, and if a player leaves a team they no longer play for that team. 

None of the premises provide any information about whether or not Robert Lewandowski is a star.  Therefore, we cannot determine if the conclusion is true or false based on the given information.

<nl_cot>
The provided premises state that Yale University's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.  However, this does not tell us if this is the largest endowment among all educational institutions. 

To determine if Yale has the largest endowment, we would need information about the endowments of other universities. Without that information, we cannot definitively say whether the statement is true or false. 

Therefore, the answer is (C) Uncertain.

1. **Premise 1:** Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
2. **Premise 2:** All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
3. **Premise 3:** All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
4. **Premise 4:** All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
5. **Premise 5:** All queen bees are bees.
6. **Premise 6:** Harry is a bee.

We know that all bees don't reproduce by male-and-female mating (Premise 4).

We also know that all animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating (Premise 2).

Therefore, Harry cannot be a vertebrate animal.

Since Harry is a bee (Premise 6) and all bees are animals (implied by Premise 1), Harry must be an invertebrate.

The conclusion states that Harry is a queen bee (Premise 5). However, we don't have enough information to determine if all invertebrates are queen bees. 

Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.

<nl_cot>
1. **Premise 1:** It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300. This information is irrelevant to whether Tom receives financial aid.
2. **Premise 2:** ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. This establishes the condition for receiving aid.
3. **Premise 3:** Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship. This provides a way to qualify for financial aid.
4. **Premise 4:** Tom lives in a single-parent family. This means Tom might be eligible for aid based on Premise 3.
5. **Premise 5:** Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. This further strengthens Tom's eligibility for aid based on Premise 3.
6. **Premise 6:** Tom is applying to take the GRE test. This is necessary for Tom to be considered for aid, as aid is only provided to applicants.

Therefore, based on the premises, we can conclude that Tom meets the criteria for proving economic hardship and is likely to receive financial aid from ETS.

64 out of 106 is correct!
<nl_cot>
The conclusion states that no one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something. 

We are given that ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. We also know that:

* Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources, meaning he can likely prove economic hardship. 
* Therefore, Tom could receive financial aid from ETS to take the GRE.

Since we have identified at least one person (Tom) who could receive financial aid, the conclusion that *no one* taking the GRE test has financial aid is false.

1. **Premise 1:** Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
2. **Premise 2:** Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
3. **Premise 3:** Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
4. **Premise 4:** Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands.
5. **Premise 5:** If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.

We want to determine if Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica.  

* We know Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. 
* We also know Barutin Cove is on Snow Island, which is part of the South Shetland Islands, which is part of Antarctica.

Therefore, Barutin Cove is named after a specific settlement, not all islands in Antarctica. 

**Conclusion:** The statement is **False**. </nl_cot>

<nl_cot>
The conclusion states that "If something is a household appliance, it sucks."  We need to determine if this is always true based on the premises.

* **Premise 1:** Plungers suck.
* **Premise 2:** Vacuums suck.
* **Premise 3:** Vampires suck.
* **Premise 4:** Space is a vacuum.
* **Premise 5:** A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck.

Notice that premises 1, 2, and 3 define "suck" in different contexts. Plungers and vacuums suck literally, while vampires suck metaphorically. Premise 4 connects "vacuum" to space, which is not a household appliance.

Premise 5 is crucial. It tells us that not all household appliances suck. Since a duster is a household appliance and doesn't suck, the conclusion is false.

86 out of 143 is correct!
<nl_cot>
The provided premises state that Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs.

This implies that aurochs are extinct because they are no longer naturally occurring and need to be recreated through selective breeding.

Therefore, the conclusion that aurochs are extinct is true.

<nl_cot>
The premises tell us that New Vessel Press is a publishing house that translates foreign literature into English. 

We also know that Neapolitan Chronicles, which was translated from Italian, was published by New Vessel Press. This suggests that New Vessel Press publishes translated works.

However, there is no information given about Harry Potter's origin or publisher. We cannot conclude whether or not Harry Potter was published by New Vessel Press based on the given premises.

The conclusion states that *no* politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag. 

We are given that Heinrich Schmidt was both a politician and a member of the Nazi Reichstag. This directly contradicts the conclusion. 

Therefore, the conclusion is false.

1. **Premise 1:** The summer Olympic games is a sporting event. This tells us that the Summer Olympics are categorized as a sporting event.
2. **Premise 2:** The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo. This provides information about the location and timing of the last Summer Olympics but doesn't directly relate to the World Championships.
3. **Premise 3:** The United States won the most medals in Tokyo. This focuses on the performance of different countries in the Summer Olympics and doesn't provide information about the World Championships.

None of the premises directly state whether the World Championships is a sporting event.  

Therefore, the conclusion "The world championships is a sporting event" is uncertain based on the given information.

1. **Premise 1:** The summer Olympic games is a sporting event. This tells us about the nature of the Summer Olympics but doesn't directly relate to the location.
2. **Premise 2:** The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo. This directly states the location of the last Summer Olympics.
3. **Premise 3:** The United States won the most medals in Tokyo. This confirms the location of the Olympics mentioned in Premise 2.
4. **Conclusion:** The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo. This contradicts Premise 2.

Since Premise 2 directly states that the last Summer Olympics were in Tokyo, and the conclusion states they were not, the conclusion is false. </nl_cot>

Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /beacon-scratch/tongzh24/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.
