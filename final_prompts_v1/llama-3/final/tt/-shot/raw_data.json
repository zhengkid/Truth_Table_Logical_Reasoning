Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... </code> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... </nl_cot> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... </truth_table> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... </code> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... </nl_cot> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... </truth_table> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent or more. The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000, which is more than $1500. \n\nNow, let's consider Tom's situation. He will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500. Since the security deposit can be equal to the monthly rent or more, the deposit for the Olive Garden would be at least $2000, which is more than $1500. \n\nHowever, we have another premise that states if a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. The Olive Garden is a managed building that allows pets, as pets are allowed in some managed buildings. Therefore, Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy.\n\nSo, we can conclude that Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

However, if his wedding is well-attended, then he invites others to their ceremony. This implies that John can't have a larger family if he's engaged.\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| E (John is engaged) | M (Makes wedding plans) | I (Invites others) | W (Well-attended wedding) | F (Larger family) |\n|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| True                | False                  | False                | False                     | False            |\n| True                | False                  | False                | False                     | True             |\n| False               | True                   | True                 | False                     | False            |\n| False               | True                   | True                 | False                     | True             |\n| False               | True                   | True                 | True                      | False            |\n| False               | True                   | True                 | True                      | True             |\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input.

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
