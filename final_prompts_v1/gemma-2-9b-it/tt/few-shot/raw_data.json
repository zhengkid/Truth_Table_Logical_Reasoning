We need to break it down and see if each part can be logically connected to the premises.\n\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| C (Chaperones) | T (Talent Shows) | S (Attends/Engaged) | Y (Young/Teen) | A (Wishes to further education) | I (Inactive/Disinterested) |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| True            | True             | True                    |             |                                     | True                 |\n| True            | True             | False                   |             |                                     | True                 |\n| True            | False            | False                   |             |                                     | True                 |\n| False           | True             | True                    |             |                                     | False                |\n| False           | True             | False                   |             |                                     | False                |\n| False           | False            | False                   |             |                                     | True                 |\n\n\n\n</truth_table>\n\n\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
