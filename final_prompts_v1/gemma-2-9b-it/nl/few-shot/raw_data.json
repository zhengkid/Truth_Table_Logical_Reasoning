        "rationale": "Step 1: We know from the premise \"Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school\" that Bonnie fits one of two scenarios: \n    * Scenario 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school.\n    * Scenario 2: Bonnie does NOT attend and is very engaged with school events AND is NOT a student who attends the school.\n\nStep 2:  The premise \"People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school\" tells us that if someone in the club chaperones dances, they cannot also be a student at the school.\n\nStep 3: The premise \"All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances\" tells us that if someone is inactive and disinterested, they will chaperone dances.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school\" tells us that if someone is a young child or teenager who wants to improve their education, they must be a student at the school.\n\nStep 5: We need to analyze Bonnie's situation based on the two scenarios:\n\n* **Scenario 1 (Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school):**  This scenario aligns with the premise \"All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school\".  Since Bonnie is a student at the school, she wouldn't be inactive and disinterested, and therefore wouldn't chaperone dances. This scenario is consistent with Bonnie performing in school talent shows often because people who perform often attend and are engaged with school events.\n\n* **Scenario 2 (Bonnie does NOT attend and is very engaged with school events AND is NOT a student who attends the school):** This scenario contradicts the premise \"All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school\" because Bonnie is not a student. This scenario also implies that Bonnie is inactive and disinterested, leading her to chaperone dances, which contradicts the premise \"People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\"\n\nStep 6: Since Scenario 2 is impossible given the premises, we can conclude that Bonnie must fit Scenario 1.\n\n\nStep 7: Because Scenario 1 is consistent with Bonnie performing in school talent shows often, we can conclude that the statement \"Bonnie performs in school talent shows often\" is **true**.\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

The statement essentially says: \n\n* **Part 1:** If James is a manager or in other countries, he doesn't have lunch at home and doesn't work remotely.\n* **Part 2:** If James has lunch at home or works remotely, he's neither a manager nor in other countries.\n\nStep 2:  We can analyze each part separately using the given premises:\n\n* **Analyzing Part 1:**\n    * \"All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.\"  \n    * \"Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.\"\n    * Combining these, we know that anyone who has lunch at the company building schedules meetings and goes to the building.\n    * \"If James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager\" means that if James is in the company building, he must be a manager. \n    * \"No managers work remotely from home\" tells us that managers cannot work remotely.\n    * Therefore, if James is a manager (and thus in the company building), he cannot have lunch at home or work remotely.\n    * \"All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home\" tells us that if James is in other countries, he works remotely from home.\n    * This contradicts the fact that managers don't work remotely, so James cannot be both a manager and in other countries.\n* **Analyzing Part 2:**\n    * \"If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.\"\n    * \"No managers work remotely from home.\"\n    * Combining these, we know that if James has lunch at home, he cannot be a manager.\n    * \"All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home\" tells us that if James works remotely, he must be in other countries.\n\nStep 3:  Putting it all together, we see that the conclusion holds true. \n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Therefore, Peter's family cannot prioritize order and spotlessness.\nStep 10: We can conclude that Peter is not a person who values order and spotlessness, and we know he does not spill a lot of food on his clothing. \nStep 11:  The only remaining option is that Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, as stated in the premise \"All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\"\n\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
