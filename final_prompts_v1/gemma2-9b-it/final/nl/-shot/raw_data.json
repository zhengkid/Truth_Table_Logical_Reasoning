Therefore, Jane does not like dogs.\nStep 2: We also know \"Jane likes all animals that jump\" and \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps\". Therefore, Jane likes all animals that have legs.\nStep 3:  The premise \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs\" tells us that if an animal is terricolous, it must have legs.\nStep 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that Jane likes all terricolous animals.\nStep 5: The premise \"KiKi is an animal\" tells us that KiKi is an animal.\nStep 6: The premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs\" is a conditional statement.  We need to analyze it carefully. \nStep 7:  Since we know Jane likes all terricolous animals (Step 4), and we know KiKi is an animal (Step 5), we can deduce that if KiKi is terricolous, Jane likes KiKi. \nStep 8:  We also know that if KiKi has legs, Jane likes KiKi (Step 2).\nStep 9: Therefore, regardless of whether KiKi is terricolous or has legs, we can conclude that Jane likes KiKi.\nStep 10: The premises do not provide information to determine if KiKi is terricolous or not. \n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",
