Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... </code> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... </nl_cot> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... </truth_table> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. \n2. Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. \n3. The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. \n4. If something is skittish, then it is not calm. \n5. All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. \n6. Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that the only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. This means that turtles cannot be spotted near the campus.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that some turtles can be spotted near the campus, which contradicts premise 3. However, this is not the case because premise 3 states that the only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: Rockie is not a turtle. \n\nFrom premise 6, we know that Rockie can be spotted near the campus and it is calm. \n\nFrom premise 5, we know that all squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. Since Rockie is calm, it cannot be a squirrel.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that if something is skittish, then it is not calm. This means that Rockie cannot be a squirrel because squirrels are skittish.\n\nSince Rockie is not a squirrel, and the only other animal that can be spotted near the campus is a rabbit (from premise 3), Rockie must be a rabbit.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that all rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. Therefore, Rockie is cute.\n\nHowever, we are not asked whether Rockie is cute or not. We are asked whether Rockie is not a turtle. \n\nFrom premise 3, we know that the only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. This means that turtles cannot be spotted near the campus.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that some turtles can be spotted near the campus, which contradicts premise 3. However, this is not the case because premise 3 states that the only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.\n\nSince turtles cannot be spotted near the campus, it is possible for Rockie to be a rabbit or a squirrel. We have already established that Rockie is not a squirrel. \n\nTherefore, Rockie must be a rabbit.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that all rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. Therefore, Rockie is cute.\n\nHowever, we are not asked whether Rockie is cute or not. We are asked whether Rockie is not a turtle. \n\nSince we have established that Rockie is a rabbit, we can conclude that Rockie is not a turtle.\n\nThe final answer is <answer> (A) </answer>",

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... </code> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... </nl_cot> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... </truth_table> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

From the premise \"Rock is Peter's pet,\" we can infer that Rock is either a monkey, a bird, or an animal. However, since Rock is not a monkey (because all monkeys are mammals, and Rock is not a mammal), and Rock is not a bird (because birds can fly, but Rock cannot fly), we can conclude that Rock must be an animal.\n\nFrom the premise \"All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals,\" we know that if Rock were a mammal, it would also be an animal. However, we already concluded that Rock is an animal, so it is not necessary to use this premise to determine that Rock is an animal.\n\nNow, we are given that all animals that are Peter's pets can breathe. Since Rock is Peter's pet and an animal, we can conclude that Rock can breathe.\n\nFrom the premise \"If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings,\" we can deduce that if Rock had wings, it would have to be able to fly.
