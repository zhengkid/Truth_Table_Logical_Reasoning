Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

However, it does not guarantee that all such restaurants have many negative reviews.\n\nStep 4: The premise \u201cAll restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four\u201d implies that if a restaurant is popular among locals, it will have a rating greater than four.\n\nStep 5: The premise \u201cThe Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents\u201d indicates that the Hamden Plaza Subway store either has a rating greater than four or is popular among local residents.\n\nStep 6: Since the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four (from the previous premise), it must be on Yelp\u2019s recommendations (from the second premise).\n\nStep 7: We know that restaurants on Yelp\u2019s recommendations tend to have fewer negative reviews (from the first premise). If the Hamden Plaza Subway store were to offer take-out service and still have a high rating, it could be inferred that the store's take-out service is not the reason for the negative reviews, which contradicts the third premise.\n\nStep 8: To avoid this contradiction, it is more likely that the Hamden Plaza Subway store does not provide take-out service.\n\nStep 9: Although we cannot definitively say that all restaurants without take-out service have many negative reviews (as the third premise only states \u201csome\u201d), we can infer that the Hamden Plaza Subway store does not offer take-out service based on the information provided.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the statement \u201cThe Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service\u201d is true.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
