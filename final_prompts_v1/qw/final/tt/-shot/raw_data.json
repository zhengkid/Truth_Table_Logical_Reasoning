People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\n2. People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\n3. People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\n4. All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n5. All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n6. Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know Bonnie is in the club and her status can be summarized as:\n- Bonnie either attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she is not someone who attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nFrom premise 2, since Bonnie is in the club, she must either perform in school talent shows often or be an inactive and disinterested community member.\n\nIf Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, she must attend and be very engaged with school events (premise 1).\n\nIf Bonnie is not someone who performs in school talent shows often, she must be an inactive and disinterested community member (premise 2).\n\nFrom premise 3, people who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school, and from premise 4, all inactive and disinterested members chaperone high school dances. This means if Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member, she must chaperone high school dances and not be a student who attends the school.\n\nHowever, from premise 5, all young children and teenagers in the club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. Since Bonnie is in the club, if she is a student who attends the school, she must be someone who wishes to further her academic careers and educational opportunities, and thus she cannot be an inactive and disinterested member.\n\nTherefore, Bonnie must perform in school talent shows often to avoid being an inactive and disinterested member.\n\nThus, the statement \"Bonnie performs in school talent shows often\" is true.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

Basque is not related to any other language.\n\nWe need to determine if German is a Romance language. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n- From premise 4, we know that both French and Spanish are Romance languages.\n- From premise 3, all languages within a language family are related to each other. Since Spanish is a Romance language and German is related to Spanish, it might seem that German could be a Romance language. However, this is not sufficient to conclude that German is a Romance language because:\n  - Premise 5 states that German is related to Spanish, but this does not automatically make German a Romance language.\n  - The definition of Romance languages (premise 2) and the fact that they are all related (premise 3) do not explicitly state that all languages related to a Romance language are also Romance languages. For instance, Basque (premise 6) is related to Spanish but is not a Romance language.\n- Therefore, the information given does not definitively prove that German is a Romance language.\n\nThe statement \"German is a Romance language\" cannot be proven true or false based on the given premises.

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
