By Premise 4, inactive and disinterested community members chaperone high school dances. By Premise 3, chaperones are not students who attend the school. This contradicts Bonnie being a student who attends the school. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion.\nSince the only consistent option is that Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, it follows that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Since all printed texts are analog media, hardcover books are also analog media.\n\nStep 3: From the premise \"If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book,\" we can use the information from step 2 to conclude that if 1984 were a streaming service, it would also be a hardcover book.

Therefore, based on Step 1, it would be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations and, based on Step 2, it would not receive many negative reviews.\nStep 6: Regardless of whether the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four or is popular among local residents, it either has not received many negative reviews or is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. This aligns with the conclusion that \"The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews.\" However, the provided premises do not give us information about whether the store provides take-out service, only about its rating and listing status in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\nStep 7: Since the premises do not provide information about the take-out service of the Hamden Plaza Subway store, we cannot definitively conclude from the premises whether the store provides take-out service or not. The premises do, however, support the part of the conclusion about not receiving many negative reviews if the store has a rating greater than four or is popular among local residents.\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

The premises do not state that the security deposit is a prerequisite for being allowed to move in with a pet.\nStep 7: Therefore, based on the information provided, Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy, but the security deposit condition prevents him from renting the apartment.\n\nThe final answer is (A).</answer>",

        "conclusions": "Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and issomeone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.",
        "rationale": "Step 1: Analyze the premise \"If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.\" This implies that people who spill a lot of food are not notably tidy, which means they are not cleanly since \"If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\"\n\nStep 2: From the premise \"All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing,\" we can infer that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently, they spill a lot of food on their clothing and are not notably tidy.\n\nStep 3: The premise \"Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly\" can be broken down. If Peter spills a lot of food and is cleanly, then from step 1, this contradicts the idea that people who spill a lot of food are not notably tidy and hence not cleanly. Thus, this part of the disjunction is false. So, Peter must be \"a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.\"\n\nStep 4: Since Peter does not spill a lot of food, he does not fit the description of a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently. \n\nStep 5: The premise \"All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness\" tells us that if a family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then the people in that family value order and spotlessness. This is important for the final part of the question.\n\nStep 6: Combining the information from steps 3 and 4, Peter neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness, since if his family did, he would value order and spotlessness, which contradicts him not being cleanly.\n\nStep 7: The statement in question is \"Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.\" Given our analysis, Peter does not fit the first part of the disjunction, and the second part is true based on our findings.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

If John has a larger family, then he must have either a well-attended wedding or invite friends to his ceremony. However, if John is engaged, he does not make wedding plans and does not invite friends to his ceremony, which means he cannot have a well-attended wedding if he is engaged.\n\nStep 8: We need to determine if John is engaged. From the premise \"If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans,\" and the fact that making wedding plans implies being engaged, we need to check if John can be engaged and not have a larger family. If John is engaged, he cannot invite friends and cannot have a well-attended wedding, which means he cannot have a larger family based on the premise \"If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.\"\n\nStep 9: Given that if John is engaged, he cannot have a well-attended wedding or invite friends, and the only way he could have a larger family is if he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends, we can conclude that John cannot have a larger family if he is engaged.\n\nStep 10: Since we do not have any information that explicitly states John is not engaged, and given that the premises suggest that if John is engaged, he cannot have a larger family, we must consider the possibility that John is not engaged. If John is not engaged, we cannot conclude anything about whether he has a larger family based on the given premises.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the statement \"John does not have a larger family\" cannot be definitively proven true or false based on the given premises. The information provided is not sufficient to determine the status of John's family size.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

If she can register to vote in the United States, then from step 1, she can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election. If she is a Russian Federation official, then from step 4, she does not have Taiwanese citizenship, and she cannot be in the \"or she is a Russian federation official\" scenario if she has Taiwanese citizenship, which means she cannot be a Russian Federation official if she has Taiwanese citizenship. This does not contradict the premise but shows the exclusivity of the two conditions.\n\nStep 7: Combining the premises, if Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, then she can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election. If she cannot register to vote in the United States, then she must be a Russian Federation official, and the premise does not allow her to have Taiwanese citizenship if she is a Russian Federation official.

However, this scenario also states that Taylor disregards her physical well-being. This contradicts the premise \"All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits,\" because people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits. Therefore, Scenario 1 is not possible.\n\nStep 3: For Scenario 2, if Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, then by the premise \"All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly,\" Taylor does not eat salads regularly. This scenario is consistent with the given premises.\n\nStep 4: Since both scenarios lead to the conclusion that Taylor does not eat salads regularly, the statement is false.\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
