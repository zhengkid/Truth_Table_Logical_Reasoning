This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nPeople in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPeople in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\nPeople in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\nAll people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nAll young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. \nBonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nBonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. \nEveryone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. \nEmployees have lunch either in the company building or at home.\nIf an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.\nAll employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. \nNo managers work remotely from home. \nJames will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nJames does not have lunch in the company.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\n\"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.\nIf a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.\nIf and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.\nKaren does not download \"Black Mirror.\"\n\"Black Mirror\" is a Netflix show.\nIf Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\n\"Black Mirror\" is popular.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? \"Black Mirror\" is popular.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>"

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll aliens are extraterrestrials.\nIf someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.\nNo extraterrestrials are human.\nAll highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.\nMarvin is a highly intelligent being.\nMarvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.\nIf Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.\nNo brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.\nEvery style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. \nAll of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.\nAll of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.\nIf a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nA design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. \nEveryone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.\nAll female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\nAll tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.\nAll male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.\nIf Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\nCoco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nCoco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nBillings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.\nThe state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.\nWhite Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.\nThe city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.\nAny city in Butte is not in St Pierre.\nA city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nMontana is home to the city of Missoula.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: given premises \"If Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\" and \"The Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up.\"\nStep 2: given premise \"If the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge.\"\nStep 3: given premise \"The Hulk is a destroyer.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge.\"\nStep 4: given premise \"Peter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian\"\nStep 5: given premise \"Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero.\"\nStep 6: given premise \"Peter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform\"\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 1>\n\n<EXAMPLE 2>\n<premises>\nAll philosophers reason.\nSome sophists reason.\nAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood.\nNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is a sophist.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll Brown Swiss cattle are cows.\nSome pets are Brown Swiss Cattle.\nAll cows are domesticated animals.\nAlligators are not domesticated animals.\nTed is an alligator.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nTed is a pet.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.\nIf people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.\nPeople at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.\nIf people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.\nIf people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\nHannah is at Mary's school.\nHannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nHannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nNo baked sweets are spicy.\nAll cupcakes are baked sweets.\nAll mala hotpots are spicy.\nAll products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.\nDried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nDried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nNo baked sweets are spicy.\nAll cupcakes are baked sweets.\nAll mala hotpots are spicy.\nAll products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.\nDried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nDried Thai chilies are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\nSome restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.\nThe Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIn superhero movies, the good guys always win.\nThe Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is a superhero movie.\nGood guys fight bad guys and vice versa.\nSir Digby fights his nemesis.\nIf a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is a good guy.\nThe Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is named after Sir Digby.\nIf somebody wins a fight, the person they are fighting does not win.\nIf a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is in the movie.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nSir Digby\u2019s nemesis does not win.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nA natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.\nIf the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.\nMachine translation is a natural language processing task.\nThe output of machine translation is a text sequence.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nMachine translation is a language understanding task.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAnimals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.\nAll animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. \nAll vertebrate animals have a backbone.\nAll bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.\nAll queen bees are bees.\nHarry is a bee.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nHarry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nPeople who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\nIf people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\nIf people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.\nIf people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\nIf people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. \nLuke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nLuke complains often about annoying siblings.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nPeople who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\nIf people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\nIf people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.\nIf people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\nIf people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. \nLuke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nLuke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIt costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\nETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.\nThose living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.\nTom lives in a single-parent family.\nTom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. \nTom is applying to take the GRE test.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nNo one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.\nAll clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\nIf people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\nIf people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\nAll people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.\nPeter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nPeter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and issomeone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\nMichael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.\nIf person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z\nPeter is a man who is taller than Michael.\nMichael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\nMichael cannot block Windy's shooting.\nEvery shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nPeter is shorter than a man in Michael's class.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\nMichael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.\nIf person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z\nPeter is a man who is taller than Michael.\nMichael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\nMichael cannot block Windy's shooting.\nEvery shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWindy is a great shooter.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nBarutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.\nBarutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.\nSnow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.\nAntarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. \nIf place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nThere is at least one cove in Antarctica named after a place in Bulgaria.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nAll Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.\nAll single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\nAll Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. \nIf John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. \n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nJohn's car is a Solo EV.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nAll Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.\nAll single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\nAll Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. \nIf John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. \n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nJohn's car is not a Solo EV.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.\nAll monkeys are mammals. \nPeter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. \nPeter's birds can fly.\nAll animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.\nIf Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.\nRock is Peter's pet.\nRock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. \n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nRock is a monkey.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.\nAll monkeys are mammals. \nPeter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. \nPeter's birds can fly.\nAll animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.\nIf Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.\nRock is Peter's pet.\nRock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. \n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nRock does not have wings.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.\nAll people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.\nAnyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.\nSome people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.\nIf John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.\nIf John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. \n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nJohn has a larger family.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.\nAll people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.\nAnyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.\nSome people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.\nIf John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.\nIf John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. \n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nJohn does not have a larger family.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nMachine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\nUnsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.\nThe state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.\nReinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.\nThe Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nUnsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.\nIf a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.\nIf a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.\nAll family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.\nAll movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is a film.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. \n</premises>\n<conclusion>\n\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series or both.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series or both.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>"

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nEveryone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\nIf someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States.\nA person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship.\nNo Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship. \nVladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom. \nEkaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nEkaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or is a manager at Gazprom.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nNone of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. \nAll of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. \nAll of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. \nAll of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. \nAll students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.\nJames is a student working in the lab. \nJames doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nJames has a part-time job offered by the university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nSome show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.\nIf a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.\nThe Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.\nAll shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.\nBreaking Bad is a show.\nBreaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nBreaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. \nSevere cancers are deadly diseases.\nBile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. \nAll Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\nMild flu comes with a low survival rate.\nColorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nColorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nAll people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\nAll people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\nAll people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nIf people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\nTaylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nTaylor eats salads regularly.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nAll people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\nAll people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\nAll people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nIf people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\nTaylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nTaylor visits the gym at least once a day.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: given premises \"If Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\" and \"The Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up.\"\nStep 2: given premise \"If the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge.\"\nStep 3: given premise \"The Hulk is a destroyer.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge.\"\nStep 4: given premise \"Peter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian\"\nStep 5: given premise \"Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero.\"\nStep 6: given premise \"Peter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform\"\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 1>\n\n<EXAMPLE 2>\n<premises>\nAll philosophers reason.\nSome sophists reason.\nAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood.\nNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is a sophist.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nSusan flies to LGA airport.\nThe departure and arrival can not be at the same airport.\nJohn flies from LGA airport.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nJohn flies to LGA airport.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nNo one nice to animals is also mean to animals.\nSome grumpy people are mean to animals.\nAll animal lovers are nice to animals.\nAll pet owners love animals.\nTom is a pet owner.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nTom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nNo one nice to animals is also mean to animals.\nSome grumpy people are mean to animals.\nAll animal lovers are nice to animals.\nAll pet owners love animals.\nTom is a pet owner.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nA podcast is not a novel.\nIf a person is born in American City, the person is American.\nIf a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer.\nDani Shapiro is an American writer.\nFamily History is written by Dani Shapiro.\nFamily History is a novel written in 2003.\nDani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets.\nBoston is an American city.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nFamily Secrets is a novel.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nSome professional basketball players are not American nationals.\nAll professional basketball players can do jump shots.\nIf someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.\nIf someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. \nYuri does not activate his leg muscles.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nJane does not like any animals that bark.\nAll dogs are animals that bark.\nJane likes all animals that jump.\nIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\nIf an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. \nKiKi is an animal.\nIf KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nKiKi is terricolous.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nJane does not like any animals that bark.\nAll dogs are animals that bark.\nJane likes all animals that jump.\nIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\nIf an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. \nKiKi is an animal.\nIf KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nKiKi is a barking dog.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nJane does not like any animals that bark.\nAll dogs are animals that bark.\nJane likes all animals that jump.\nIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\nIf an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. \nKiKi is an animal.\nIf KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nKiKi does not bark and he is not a dog.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAilton Silva played for Fluminense.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
