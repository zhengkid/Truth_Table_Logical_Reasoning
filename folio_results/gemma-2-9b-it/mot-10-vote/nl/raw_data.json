            "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis:**\n\n   - We know that club members are either active participants (perform in talent shows) or inactive members.\n\n   - Inactive members are those who chaperone high school dances.\n\n   -  Students in the club who wish to further their academic careers are active participants.\n\n2. **Bonnie's Situation:**\n\n   - Bonnie is either an active, engaged member of the club OR she is not.\n\n3. **Conditional Statement:**\n\n   - The statement we're analyzing is a conditional: \"If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\"\n\n4. **Deduction:**\n\n   - If Bonnie chaperones, she's inactive and disinterested.\n   - If Bonnie doesn't chaperone, she performs in talent shows, making her an active, engaged member.\n   -  Active, engaged members are students who wish to further their academic careers.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\n   - Therefore, regardless of whether Bonnie chaperones or not, the conclusion holds true. She fits the description of a young child/teenager who wishes to further her academic career and an inactive/disinterested member of the community.\n\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>A</answer>\n<end_of_answer>",

It states that if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or performs in school talent shows often, she must be both a young child/teenager wishing to further her education and an inactive/disinterested community member.

Since Premise 3 states that all of Max's adored styles are either Zaha Hadid or Kelly Wearstler, we know that at least one of these qualities (evocative or dreamy) must apply to every design Max adores. \n\nTherefore, the statement is **true**. </nl_cot>\n<answer>A</answer>\n<end_of_answer>",

However, premise 6 states that if a design is both interesting and evocative, it must be brutalist. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy\" must be **true**. </nl_cot>\n<answer>A</answer> \n<end_of_answer>"

            "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Premise:** Some shows airing at 8 pm on Monday give out roses on TV.\n2. **Premise:** If a show gives out roses on TV, then it is an episode of The Bachelor.\n3. **Premise:** The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.\n4. **Premise:** All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.\n5. **Premise:** Breaking Bad is a show.\n6. **Premise:** Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n\nFrom premises 3, 4, and 6, we can conclude that Breaking Bad is not an episode of The Bachelor.\n\nTherefore, if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, it cannot be an episode of The Bachelor.\n\nSince the only shows mentioned that give out roses on TV are those airing at 8 pm on Monday and episodes of The Bachelor, we can conclude that if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, it cannot be airing at 8 pm on Monday.\n\nThus, the statement \"If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm\" is **False**.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>B</answer>\n<end_of_answer>",
            "Let's analyze the premises to see if we can reach the conclusion. \n\nPremise 1: Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV. This tells us there's at least one show fitting this description.\n\nPremise 2: If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor. This establishes a direct link between giving out roses and being The Bachelor.\n\nPremise 3: The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. This connects The Bachelor to the concept of portraying real lives.\n\nPremise 4: All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. This links portraying real lives to being a reality TV show.\n\nPremise 5: Breaking Bad is a show. This establishes Breaking Bad as a show, but doesn't tell us anything else about it.\n\nPremise 6: Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. This contradicts the potential link established through Premise 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm.\n\nSince we know from Premise 2 that shows giving out roses are The Bachelor, and Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show (Premise 6), it cannot be The Bachelor. Therefore, if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, it cannot be on Monday at 8 pm. </nl_cot>\n<answer>B</answer> \n<end_of_answer>",

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
