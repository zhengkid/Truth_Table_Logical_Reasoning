It states that if Bonnie meets certain conditions (being a young student who chaperones OR not being one), she must either be a student or inactive.\n\nStep 3: Break down Bonnie's situation based on the premises.  We know:\n    - Bonnie is either:\n        - Active and engaged (a student by premise 1)\n        - Inactive and not engaged (and thus a chaperone by premise 4)\n\nStep 4: Consider the possible scenarios based on Bonnie's situation:\n\n    - **Scenario 1: Bonnie is active and engaged.**  This means she's a student (premise 1). The conclusion holds true in this case.\n    - **Scenario 2: Bonnie is inactive and not engaged.** This means she's a chaperone (premise 4). Since chaperones are not students (premise 3), the conclusion also holds true in this case.\n\nStep 5: Since the conclusion holds true for both possible scenarios of Bonnie's situation, it is a guaranteed outcome.\n\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

So, if The Olive Garden allows pets, Tom can move in with Fluffy.\nStep 4: The premise states that \"The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000\" and \"$2000 is more than $1500\". This means the security deposit at The Olive Garden could be $2000 or more.\nStep 5: Tom will only rent an apartment if the security deposit is no more than $1500. \nStep 6: Since the security deposit at The Olive Garden is more than $1500, Tom will not rent an apartment there.\n\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>",
