This part of the conclusion holds true for Category 1.\n\nStep 4: However, the premise \"People in this club who perform in school talent shows often are students who attend the school\"  implies that if Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, she likely performs in school talent shows often. This contradicts the conclusion, which states that if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nStep 5: Now consider Category 2: \"Bonnie does not attend and is very engaged with school events, and is not a student who attends the school.\"  The premise \"All people in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school\"  implies that if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she is not a student who attends the school.
