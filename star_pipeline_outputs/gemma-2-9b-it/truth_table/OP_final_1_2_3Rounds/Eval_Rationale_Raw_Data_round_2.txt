This contradicts the conclusion's first part.\n\n* **Part 2:**\n    * If Peter is not a clumsy foodie (\u00acC), then he is cleanly (premises 6).\n    * If he is cleanly, then he is notably tidy (premises 3).\n    * If he is notably tidy, then his family prioritizes order and spotlessness (premises 5).\n    * Therefore, if Peter is not a clumsy foodie, his family prioritizes order and spotlessness.
