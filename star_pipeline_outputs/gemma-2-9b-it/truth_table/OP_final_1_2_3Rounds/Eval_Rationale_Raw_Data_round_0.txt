(T \u2192 S)\n    People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members. (T \u2228 I)\n    People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school. (C \u2192 \u00acA)\n    All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. (I \u2192 C)\n    All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. (Y \u2227 A)\n    Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school. ( (S \u2227 A) \u2228 (\u00acS \u2227 \u00acA) )\nConclusion to Evaluate:\n    If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. ( (C \u2228 (\u00acC \u2227 T)) \u2192 (Y \u2227 I) )\n\nLogical Chain:\n    We need to analyze the complex conditional statement in the conclusion.\n\n    Let's break it down:\n    * **(C \u2228 (\u00acC \u2227 T))**: This part states that Bonnie either chaperones high school dances (C) or, if she doesn't, she performs in school talent shows often (\u00acC \u2227 T).\n    * **(Y \u2227 I)**: This part states that Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities (Y) and an inactive and disinterested member of the community (I).\n\n    To prove this conclusion true, we need to show that if the first part is true, the second part must also be true.\n\n    * **Assume (C \u2228 (\u00acC \u2227 T)) is true.** This means either Bonnie chaperones or she performs in talent shows.\n    * **Analyze the implications based on the premises:**\n        * If Bonnie chaperones (C), then she is not a student (\u00acA) and, according to premise 4, she is inactive and disinterested (I). This fulfills (Y \u2227 I).\n        * If Bonnie performs in talent shows (\u00acC \u2227 T), then she attends and is engaged with school events (T \u2192 S), and is not inactive and disinterested (T \u2228 I). This doesn't necessarily imply (Y \u2227 I).\n\n    * **Therefore, the conclusion is not always true.** There are cases where Bonnie performs in talent shows and is not both a young child/teenager and inactive/disinterested.\n\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| C (Chaperones) | T (Talent Shows) | S (Attends/Engaged) | A (Student) | Y (Young/Academic) | I (Inactive/Disinterested) | (C \u2228 (\u00acC \u2227 T)) | (Y \u2227 I) |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------|\n| True            | False           | True                  | False        | True                | True               | True                | True         |\n| False           | True            | True                  | False        | True                | False              | True                | False        |\n| False           | False           | False                 | False        | False               | True               | False               | False        |\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

If we assume **M \u2227 S**, then by premise 1, Luke spends a lot of time with siblings.\n    *  By premise 5, if Luke spends a lot of time with siblings, he often lives at home.\n    *  By premise 4, if he lives at home, he doesn't live with strangers. This contradicts our initial assumption (M \u2227 S).\n3. Therefore, **\u00acM \u2227 \u00acS** must be true.\n4.  If **\u00acM \u2227 \u00acS** is true, then Luke does not have siblings born together.\n5.
