Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\n\"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.\nIf a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.\nIf and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.\nKaren does not download \"Black Mirror.\"\n\"Black Mirror\" is a Netflix show.\nIf Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nKaren will share \"Black Mirror\" with Lisa.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Karen will share \"Black Mirror\" with Lisa.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll business organizations are legal entities.\nAll companies are business organizations.\nAll private companies are companies.\nAll legal entities are created under law. \nAll legal entities have legal obligations.\nIf the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nEveryone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\nIf someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States.\nA person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship.\nNo Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship. \nVladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom. \nEkaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nVladimir is a Russian federation official\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"
