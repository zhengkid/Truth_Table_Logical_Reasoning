(S \u2227 (\u00acP \u2228 (P \u2192 F)))\nLogical Chain:\n    From (6), we know S is True.\n    From (7), we know J \u2227 T \u2192 \u00ac(P \u2227 T).  This means if Hannah works in student jobs and needs to earn money, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money. This is a complex condition, and we'll need to analyze it further.\n    Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        * **Case 1: J is True, T is True:** \n            * In this case, the premise (7) states that J \u2227 T \u2192 \u00ac(P \u2227 T) is True.\n            * Since J and T are True, this means \u00ac(P \u2227 T) must be True. \n            * Therefore, P and T cannot both be True.\n        * **Case 2: J is True, T is False:**\n            * In this case, the premise (7) does not directly apply.\n        * **Case 3: J is False, T is True:**\n            * In this case, the premise (7) does not directly apply.\n        * **Case 4: J is False, T is False:**\n            * In this case, the premise (7) does not directly apply.\n    \n    Now, let's analyze the premises (1), (2), and (3) to see if we can determine anything about J, O, and D:\n        * We know S is True.\n        * We don't know if J, O, or D are True or False.\n\n    We need more information to definitively determine the truth value of the conclusion. \n\n\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| S (Hannah is at Mary's school) | J (Hannah works in student jobs) | T (Hannah needs to earn money) | O (Hannah orders takeout frequently) | D (Hannah enjoys dining hall meals) | P (Hannah is a picky eater) | F (Hannah spends a lot of time in dining halls) |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| True                               | True                               | True                               | True                            | True                            | False                           | True                            |\n| True                               | True                               | True                               | True                            | False                           | True                            | True                            |\n| True                               | True                               | False                              | True                            | True                            | False                           | True                            |\n| True                               | True                               | False                              | False                           | True                            | False                           | True                            |\n| True                               | False                              | True                               | True                            | True                            | False                           | True                            |\n| True                               | False                              | True                               | False                           | True                            | False                           | True                            |\n| True                               | False                              | False                              | True                            | True                            | False                           | True                            |\n| True                               | False                              | False                              | False                           | True                            | False                           | True                            |\n| True                               | False                              | True                               | True                            | False                           | True                            | True                            |\n| True                               | False                              | True                               | False                           | False                           | True                            | True                            |\n| True                               | False                              | False                              | True                            | False                           | True                            | True                            |\n| True                               | False                              | False                              | False                           | False                           | True                            | True                            |\n\n\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    * **Case 1: Peter is clumsy and has a family that prioritizes order and spotlessness (C \u2227 S)**\n        * From (2), if Peter is clumsy, then he spills a lot of food (C \u2192 Cl).\n        * From (4), if Peter values order and spotlessness, then he is cleanly (T \u2192 F).\n        * From (1), if Peter spills a lot of food, then he is not tidy (Cl \u2192 \u00acT).\n        * From (5), if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then he values order and spotlessness (S \u2192 F).\n        * Therefore, if Peter is clumsy and has a family that prioritizes order and spotlessness, he cannot be both cleanly and tidy, contradicting the premise (6). \n    * **Case 2: Peter is neither clumsy nor has a family that prioritizes order and spotlessness (\u00acC \u2227 \u00acS)**\n        * From (6), Peter is either clumsy and cleanly or not clumsy and not cleanly.\n        * If Peter is not clumsy, then he does not spill a lot of food (\u00acC \u2192 \u00acCl).\n        * If Peter is not cleanly, then he is not tidy (\u00acF \u2192 \u00acT).\n        * Therefore, if Peter is neither clumsy nor has a family that prioritizes order and spotlessness, he must be not clumsy and not cleanly, which satisfies the premise (6).\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| C (Clumsy Foodie) | S (Family Prioritizes Order) | Cl (Spills a lot) | F (Cleanly) | T (Notably Tidy) | (C \u2227 S) | (\u00acC \u2227 \u00acS) |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| True                 | True                        | True                | True              | False                | True                | False               |\n| True                 | True                        | True                | False             | False                | True                | False               |\n| True                 | False                       | True                | True              | False                | False               | False              |\n| True                 | False                       | True                | False             | False                | False               | False              |\n| False                | True                        | False               | True              | False                | False               | False              |\n| False                | True                        | False               | False             | False                | False               | False              |\n| False                | False                       | False               | True              | False                | False               | True                |\n| False                | False                       | False               | False             | False                | False               | True                |\n\n\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",
