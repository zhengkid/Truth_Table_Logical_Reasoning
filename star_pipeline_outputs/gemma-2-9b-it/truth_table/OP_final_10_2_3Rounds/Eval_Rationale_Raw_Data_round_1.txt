Assume M \u2227 E is true.\n    - From (1), if M is true, then S must be true.\n    - From (3), if A is true, then S must be true.\n    - Therefore, if M \u2227 E is true, then S must be true.\n    - But, if S is true, then H must be true (from 5).\n    - This contradicts our assumption that E is true (H \u2192 \u00acE).\n4. Therefore, M \u2227 E must be false.\n5. This means \u00acM \u2227 \u00acE must be true.\n6. From (2), if \u00acM is true, then \u00acA must also be true (since A \u2192 S and S is false).\n7.

Since \u00acM is True, Yuri does not leap straight into the air (\u00acL).\n    From (2) and (3), if someone can do jump shots (J), then they leap straight into the air (L). Since Yuri does not leap straight into the air (\u00acL), Yuri cannot do jump shots (\u00acJ).\n    From (1), we know that not all professional basketball players are American. Therefore, Yuri not being an American professional basketball player is possible.\n    \nConclusion to Evaluate:\n    If Yuri does not leap straight into the air (\u00acL), then Yuri is an American professional basketball player (A).\n\nTruth Table:\n| A (Yuri is an American professional basketball player) | J (Yuri can do jump shots) | L (Yuri leaps straight into the air) | M (Yuri activates his leg muscles) | \u00acL (Yuri does not leap straight into the air) | \u00acJ (Yuri cannot do jump shots) |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| True                                               | True                      | True                           | True                           | False                          | False                           |\n| True                                               | True                      | False                          | False                          | True                           | True                            |\n| True                                               | False                     | True                           | True                           | False                          | True                            |\n| True                                               | False                     | False                          | False                          | True                           | True                            |\n| False                                              | True                      | True                           | True                           | False                          | False                           |\n| False                                              | True                      | False                          | False                          | True                           | True                            |\n| False                                              | False                     | True                           | True                           | False                          | True                            |\n| False                                              | False                     | False                          | False                          | True                           | True                            |\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",
