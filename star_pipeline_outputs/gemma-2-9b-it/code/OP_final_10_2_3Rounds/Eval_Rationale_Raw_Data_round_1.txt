Let's analyze the premises to see if this is true, false, or uncertain.\n\n* **Premise 1:** Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV. This tells us there's at least one show that fits this description, but it doesn't say *all* shows airing at 8 pm on Monday give out roses.\n* **Premise 2:** If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor. This establishes a direct link between giving out roses and being The Bachelor.\n* **Premise 3:** The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. This links The Bachelor to the portrayal of real people.\n* **Premise 4:** All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. This links the portrayal of real people to reality TV.\n* **Premise 5:** Breaking Bad is a show. This establishes Breaking Bad as a show.\n* **Premise 6:** Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. This contradicts the chain of logic from Premise 3 and 4.\n\nSince we know Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, and we know The Bachelor is a reality TV show (from Premise 2 and 3), we can conclude that Breaking Bad cannot be The Bachelor.  \n\nTherefore, if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, it cannot be the show airing at 8 pm on Monday.\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>",
