Combining 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can see that if Bonnie is a student who attends the school, then she cannot chaperone high school dances.\n\n6. Therefore, Bonnie must not be a student who attends the school and is inactive/disinterested in her community.\n\n7. This means Bonnie must be someone who attends and is engaged with school events.\n\n8. Finally, from Premise 1, if Bonnie attends and is engaged with school events, then she performs in school talent shows often.\n\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",
