So, if a member's `performs_talent_shows` is True, their `attends_events` and `is_engaged` are set to True.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:**\n   - This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no further changes are made to the `ClubMember` object's attributes. This ensures that all logical consequences of the premises are applied.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:**\n   - After running inference, it returns \"True\" if `member.performs_talent_shows` is True, indicating Bonnie performs in talent shows often, otherwise \"False\".\n\n5. **`func` Function:**\n   - Creates a `ClubMember` object representing Bonnie and calls `check_conclusion` to determine the answer.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe code will output:\n\n```\nConclusion: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often? False\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nPremise 6 states that Bonnie either attends and is engaged with school events *and* is a student, or she doesn't attend/engage and isn't a student.  However, this doesn't tell us anything definitive about whether she performs in talent shows.",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

This ensures that all applicable inferences have been drawn.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion(person)` Function:**\n   - After running inference, this function checks the final value of the `lives_in_tax_haven` attribute of the `Person` object.\n   - If it's `True`, it returns \"True\"; otherwise, it returns \"False\".\n\n5. **`func()` Function:**\n   - This is the main function that sets up the `Person` object with the initial information about Djokovic (you need to fill in these details based on the premises).\n   - It then calls `check_conclusion` to determine the final answer.\n\n\n\n**Remember:** You need to complete the `func()` function by setting the appropriate attributes for Djokovic based on the premises.",

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It handles the logical relationships between the attributes.\n\n2. **`run_inference(restaurant)`:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no more changes are made to the restaurant's state, effectively performing the logical reasoning process.\n\n3. **`check_conclusion(restaurant)`:** This function evaluates the conclusion based on the final state of the `Restaurant` object. It returns \"True\" if the conclusion holds, \"False\" if it does not, and \"Uncertain\" if there is not enough information to determine the truth value.\n\n4. **`func()`:** This function creates a `Restaurant` object and calls `check_conclusion` to determine the final result.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logic puzzles you'd like me to solve!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

For example:\n     - If a premise states that \"The Olive Garden is a managed building,\" it sets the `managed` attribute of the `Building` object representing \"The Olive Garden\" to `True`.\n     - If a premise states that \"Tom will rent an apartment... if the security deposit is no more than $1500,\" it updates the `can_move_in` attribute of the `Person` object representing Tom based on the conditions.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:**\n   - This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no more changes are made to the object states. This simulates the process of running inference until a stable state is reached.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:**\n   - After running inference, this function checks the final state of the `Person` object representing Tom.\n   - If `person.can_move_in` is `True`, it returns \"True\" (the conclusion is supported), otherwise \"False.\"\n\n5. **`func` Function:**\n   - This function initializes the `Building`, `Pet`, and `Person` objects with initial states based on the given premises.\n   - It then calls `check_conclusion` to determine the final result.\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - The code prints the conclusion: \"Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy?\" followed by either \"True\" or \"False\" based on the inference.",

                "content": "You are a programming assistant that generates executable Python code for logical inference tasks. Your task is to produce code that:\n\n1. Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It has attributes for whether they are applying to the test and whether they have financial aid.\n\n2. **`apply_premises` Function:**\n   - This function updates the `has_financial_aid` attribute of the `applicant` based on the given premises.\n   - It checks if the applicant is applying to the test and if they have financial aid. \n   - If they are applying and have not been assigned financial aid yet, it sets `has_financial_aid` to `True` based on the premises about economic hardship.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:**\n   - This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no more changes are made to the applicant's state.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:**\n   - This function checks the final value of `has_financial_aid` after inference.\n   - If `has_financial_aid` is `True`, the conclusion is `False` because someone taking the GRE does have financial aid.\n   - If `has_financial_aid` is `None` (meaning the information is still uncertain), the conclusion is `Uncertain`.\n\n5. **`func` Function:**\n   - This function creates a `GREApplicant` object representing Tom and calls the other functions to run the inference and check the conclusion.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nConclusion: No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something?

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3.

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3.

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It has attributes for whether it's family-friendly animated, rated General Audience, and contains excessive content.\n\n2. **`apply_premises` Function:** This function updates the `Film` object's attributes based on the premises. \n   - It handles the linked premises about appropriateness and content.\n   - It sets the `is_rated_general_audience` attribute based on family-friendliness.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:**  This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no more changes are made to the `Film` object.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:**  This function determines the truth value of the conclusion based on the final state of the `Film` object.\n\n5. **`func` Function:**  This function sets up the initial state of the `Film` object and calls `check_conclusion` to get the result.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- The code explicitly encodes the logical relationships between the premises.\n- It handles uncertainty by using `Optional` types for attributes that might not be known initially.\n- The `apply_premises` function iteratively updates the `Film` object based on the premises, ensuring that the state is consistent.\n- The `check_conclusion` function directly evaluates the conclusion based on the final state of the `Film` object.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more examples or questions!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3.

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It handles the logical implications of each premise.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no more changes are made to the student's attributes, effectively running the inference process.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:** This function checks the final state of the `Student` object after inference. If the student is taking the database course or has a part-time job, it returns \"True\"; otherwise, it returns \"False\".\n\n5. **`func` Function:** This function creates a `Student` object representing James, runs the inference process, and returns the result of the conclusion check.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It then defines functions to apply premises, run inference, and check the conclusion. \n\nThe `apply_premises` function updates the attributes of the `Show` object based on the given premises. The `run_inference` function iteratively applies the premises until no further changes occur. The `check_conclusion` function returns \"Uncertain\" because the premises do not provide enough information to determine whether \"Breaking Bad\" airs on Monday at 8 pm.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logic puzzles you'd like to solve!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3.

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3.

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It iterates through each premise and updates the `Person` object's attributes accordingly. For example, if a premise states that people who eat salads regularly are health-conscious, it sets the `health_conscious` attribute to `True` if the `eats_salad_regularly` attribute is `True`.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no more changes are made to the `Person` object's attributes. This ensures that all applicable inferences are drawn from the premises.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:** This function checks the final value of the `visits_gym` attribute of the `Person` object after running the inference. If `visits_gym` is `True`, it returns \"True\"; otherwise, it returns \"False\".\n\n5. **`func` Function:** This function creates a `Person` object representing Taylor, runs the inference process, and returns the result of the conclusion check.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logical inference problems you'd like to solve.",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It handles logical deductions and ensures consistency with the premises.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no further changes occur in the `Person` object's state.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:** This function performs the final check based on the conclusion.\n\n5. **`func` Function:** This function creates a `Person` object representing Tom, runs the inference, and returns the result (\"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\").\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other examples you'd like me to solve!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

If it is, the conclusion is \"True\"; otherwise, it's \"False\".\n5. **`func` Function:**\n   - Creates a `Footballer` object for Ailton with initial values set to `None`.\n   - Calls `check_conclusion` to determine the truth value of the conclusion.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe code will print:\n\n```\nConclusion: Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club?

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #
