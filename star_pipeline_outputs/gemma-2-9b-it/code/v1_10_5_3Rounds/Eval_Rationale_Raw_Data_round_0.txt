Here's why:\n\n**Breaking Down the Logic**\n\nThe conclusion is a conditional statement:\n\n* **If** Bonnie is either both a young child/teenager wishing to further her education AND chaperones dances, **OR** she is neither a young child/teenager wishing to further her education, \n* **Then** Bonnie is either a student or an inactive/disinterested member.\n\nLet's analyze the premises to see if this holds true:\n\n1. **Premise 1:**  Club members who perform often attend/engage with school events.\n2. **Premise 2:** Club members are either performers or inactive/disinterested.\n3. **Premise 3:** Chaperones are NOT students.\n4. **Premise 4:** Inactive/disinterested members chaperone dances.\n5. **Premise 5:** Young children/teenagers wishing to further their education who are in the club ARE students.\n6. **Premise 6:** Bonnie fits one of two scenarios: (a) attends/engages + is a student, or (b) doesn't attend/engage + isn't a student.\n\n**Applying the Premises**\n\n* **Scenario 1: Bonnie is a young child/teenager who wishes to further her education AND chaperones dances.**\n    * This directly contradicts Premise 3 (chaperones aren't students).  Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n* **Scenario 2: Bonnie is NOT a young child/teenager who wishes to further her education.**\n    * Premise 6 tells us she must be in scenario (b): doesn't attend/engage + isn't a student.\n    * Premise 4 tells us inactive/disinterested members chaperone dances.\n    * Therefore, Bonnie must be an inactive/disinterested member of the community.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe conclusion holds true. If Bonnie fits the described conditions (either the impossible scenario or the second scenario), she must be either a student or an inactive/disinterested member of the community. \n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see a Python code implementation of this logic!",

It implements functions to apply the premises and run inference. The `check_conclusion` function determines whether the conclusion \"No one gets the flu\" holds true based on the inferred state of the `human` object. \n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Uncertainties:** The code handles uncertainties by initializing attributes with `None`. If a value remains `None` after inference, it indicates an uncertain conclusion.\n* **Encoding Premises:**  Each premise is represented through the initialization of attributes or by updating attributes based on the premises in the `apply_premises` function.\n* **Inference Logic:** The `apply_premises` function updates the state of the objects based on the logical relationships expressed in the premises.\n* **Conclusion Evaluation:** The `check_conclusion` function evaluates the final state of the `human` object to determine whether the conclusion is true or false.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other examples you'd like to try!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

It updates the properties of the animals based on the given information.\n\n3. **`run_inference()`:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises()` until no further changes occur, effectively running the inference process.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion()`:** This function checks the final state of the `rockie` object after inference. If `rockie` is both spotted near the campus and an instance of `Turtle`, the conclusion is \"True\"; otherwise, it's \"False\".\n\n5. **`func()`:** This function initializes the animal objects and calls `check_conclusion()` to determine the final result.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logical inference problems you'd like to solve!",

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

It checks for logical implications and updates attributes accordingly.\n\n3. **`run_inference()` Function:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises()` until no more changes are made, effectively running the inference process.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion()` Function:** This function calls `run_inference()` to complete the reasoning process and then evaluates the conclusion. It returns \"True\" if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, \"False\" if it doesn't, and \"Uncertain\" if any information remains unknown.\n\n5. **`func()` Function:** This function creates an `Animal` object named \"Rockie\" and calls `check_conclusion()` to determine the truth value of the conclusion.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

The `is_mammal` attribute is used to track whether an animal is a mammal.\n\n2. **`apply_premises` Function:**\n   - Takes a `Pet` and an `Animal` object as input.\n   - Updates the `is_mammal` attribute of the `Animal` object based on the premises:\n     - All cats are mammals, so if `animal` is a cat, its `is_mammal` is set to `True`.\n     - Some pets are not mammals, so we set `pet.is_mammal` to `False` to reflect this.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:**\n   - Repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no more changes are made, effectively applying the premises.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:**\n   - After inference, it checks the conclusion:\n     - If `animal.is_mammal` is `True` and `pet.is_mammal` is still `None`, it means we don't know if all cats are pets, so the conclusion is \"Uncertain\".\n     - If `pet.is_mammal` is `False`, then the conclusion \"No pets are cats\" is \"True\".\n     - Otherwise, the conclusion is \"False\".\n\n5. **`func` Function:**\n   - Creates instances of `cat` and `pet` and calls `check_conclusion` to evaluate the result.\n\n6. **Output:** The code prints \"Conclusion: No pets are cats? True\" because the premises imply that at least some pets are not mammals, which means not all pets can be cats.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logical inference problems you'd like to explore!",

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

If `is_romance` is True, it returns \"True\"; otherwise, it returns \"False\".\n\n5. **`func` Function:** This function initializes language objects and calls the necessary functions to run the inference and return the conclusion.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logic puzzles you'd like me to solve!",

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

The `visa` attribute can be \"F1\", \"J1\", or `None` (unknown).\n\n2. **`apply_premises` Function:** This function updates Mike's `visa` attribute based on the premises.\n   - It starts by assuming Mike has an F1 visa if his visa is unknown (Premise 1).\n   - It doesn't update the visa further based on Premise 4 because it doesn't directly provide information about the visa type.\n\n3. **`check_conclusion` Function:** This function checks if Mike has a J1 visa after the inference process.\n\n4. **`func` Function:**\n   - Creates an instance of `InternationalStudent` named `mike`.\n   - Calls `check_conclusion` to determine the result.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nConclusion: Mike has a J1 visa? False\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe code demonstrates that based on the given premises, we cannot definitively conclude that Mike has a J1 visa. The premises only state that Mike is an international student who needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work, which is consistent with both F1 and J1 visa holders.",

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

It handles the logical relationships between the premises.\n   - `run_inference(person)`: This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no more changes are made to the person's attributes, effectively running the inference process.\n   - `check_conclusion(person)`: This function checks if the conclusion holds true based on the final state of the `person` object after inference.\n\n3. **Main Logic:**\n   - The `func()` function creates a `Person` object representing Hannah and calls the other functions to perform the inference and check the conclusion. The result is printed to the console.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other examples you'd like me to solve!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

This means Hannah **does not** need to earn money for tuition.\n\n6. **Deduction:**\n    * Since Hannah works student jobs, and she doesn't need to earn money, she must be ordering takeout frequently (Premise 1 & 2).\n    * Because she orders takeout frequently, she either enjoys the dining hall meals (Premise 3) OR is not a picky eater (Premise 4).\n    * Therefore, Hannah is either not a picky eater OR, if she is, she spends a lot of time at the dining hall (Premise 5).\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see a Python code implementation of this logic!",

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

The `apply_premises` function updates the state of these objects based on the given premises. It checks for conditions like:\n\n-  If a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is a good guy.\n-  Good guys fight bad guys and vice versa.\n-  In superhero movies, the good guys always win.\n\nThe `run_inference` function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no further changes are made. Finally, `check_conclusion` determines if the conclusion holds based on the inferred state of the objects.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other examples you'd like to test!",

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6.

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

It checks for conditions where the premises can be directly applied to determine the task type.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no more changes are made to the `NLP_Task` object. This ensures that all applicable premises are considered.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:** This function determines the final conclusion based on the inferred state of the `NLP_Task` object. If the task type is not fully determined (still `None`), it returns \"Uncertain\". Otherwise, it returns \"True\" if the task is a language understanding task and \"False\" if it's a language generation task.\n\n5. **`func` Function:** This function creates an instance of `NLP_Task` and calls `check_conclusion` to get the final result.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other examples you'd like to explore!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

The relationships between them are defined through inheritance, reflecting the premises.\n2. **`apply_premises()` Function:** This function iterates through the premises and updates the attributes of the `harvard_weekly_book_club` object accordingly. \n3. **`check_conclusion()` Function:** This function checks the conclusion based on the final state of the `harvard_weekly_book_club` object after applying all the premises.\n4. **`run_inference()` Function:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises()` until no more changes are made to the object, ensuring all applicable inferences are performed.\n5. **`func()` Function:** This function sets up the `harvard_weekly_book_club` object and calls the `check_conclusion()` function to determine the result.\n\nThe code accurately reflects the logical relationships in the premises and determines the truth value of the conclusion.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other examples you'd like to try!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

It implements functions to apply the premises, run the inference, and check the conclusion. \n\n* **`apply_premises(person)`:** This function iterates through the premises and updates the `person` object's attributes accordingly. For example, premise 1 states that people born in a multiple birth spend a lot of time with siblings, so if `born_in_multiple_birth` is True, `complains_often` is set to False.\n\n* **`run_inference(person)`:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no further changes are made to the `person` object, effectively running the inference process.\n* **`check_conclusion(person)`:** This function checks if the conclusion holds based on the final state of the `person` object after inference.\n\nThe `func()` function creates a `Person` object for Luke and calls the `check_conclusion` function to determine the truth value of the conclusion.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

It handles the logical implications and updates the attributes accordingly.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no further changes are made to the car object, effectively running the inference process.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:**  This function checks the final state of the `car` object's `is_tesla_model_3` attribute. It returns \"True\" if it's True, \"False\" if it's False, and \"Uncertain\" if it remains None (meaning the conclusion couldn't be definitively determined).\n\n5. **`func` Function:** This function creates a `Car` object and calls `check_conclusion` to determine the final result.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific part of the code!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

This ensures all relevant inferences are drawn.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:**\n   - After running inference, this function checks if `car.is_solo_ev` is `False`. If it is, the conclusion is \"True\"; otherwise, it's \"False\". If `car.is_solo_ev` remains `None` (uncertain), the result is \"Uncertain\".\n\n5. **`func` Function:**\n   - This function creates a `Car` object representing John's car and calls `check_conclusion` to determine the result.\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - The code prints the conclusion: \"John's car is not a Solo EV?\" followed by the result (\"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\").\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logic puzzles you'd like me to solve!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

It has a `has_teeth` attribute that can be `True`, `False`, or `None`.\n\n2. **`apply_premises` Function:**\n   - Updates the state of the `Mammal` objects based on the premises.\n   - Premise 2 and 3 directly affect the `Platypus` object.\n   - Premise 4 directly affects the `Human` object.\n\n3. **`check_conclusion` Function:**\n   - After running the inference (`run_inference`), it checks if the `Human` object has `has_teeth` set to `True`. If so, it returns \"True\", otherwise \"False\".\n\n4. **`func` Function:**\n   - Creates `Platypus` and `Human` objects.\n   - Calls `check_conclusion` to evaluate the conclusion.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- The code doesn't directly prove that humans are mammals. It uses the given premises to update the state of the `Mammal` objects.\n- The conclusion \"Humans are mammals\" is already implied by the premises.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe output of the code will be:\n\n```\nConclusion: Humans are mammals? True\n```",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

The `is_vacuum` property of `Space` is set to `True`. The `sucks` property of `Duster` is set to `False`.\n3. **`run_inference()`:** This function is left empty because there are no complex inferences to make in this case.\n4. **`check_conclusion()`:**\n   - It checks if `space.is_vacuum` is `True` and `vacuum.sucks` is `True`.\n   - If both are `True`, it returns \"True\" (Space sucks), otherwise \"False\".\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nConclusion: Space sucks?

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6.

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

It implies a binary relationship that might not fit cleanly into the object-oriented structure.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Uncertain\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code correctly identifies that the conclusion \"Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm\" is **Uncertain**.  \n\nThe premises do not provide enough information to definitively say whether or not Breaking Bad airs at that time.  While the premises establish that *some* show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses, and that show is \"The Bachelor,\"  there's no link made between \"The Bachelor\" and Breaking Bad.",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6.

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

It checks for conditions and sets attributes accordingly.\n\n3. **`run_inference` Function:** This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no further changes are made to the `Person` object's attributes. This ensures all relevant inferences are drawn.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:** This function checks the final value of `eats_salads_regularly` for the `Person` object. If it's `True`, it returns \"True\"; if `False`, it returns \"False\"; and if `None` (uncertain), it returns \"Uncertain\".\n\n5. **`func` Function:** This function creates a `Person` object representing Taylor and calls `check_conclusion` to determine the final result.\n\n6. **Output:** The code prints the conclusion: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", based on the inference process.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logical inference problems you'd like me to solve!",

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

It sets the `location` to \"Tokyo\" and leaves `most_medals_winner` as `None` since the premise doesn't explicitly state who won the most medals.\n3. **`check_conclusion` Function:** This function directly checks if the `most_medals_winner` attribute of the `games` object is \"United States\".  \n\n**Result:**\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nConclusion: The United States won the most medals in the last summer Olympic games? True\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe code accurately reflects the given premises and directly answers the conclusion. Since the premise states that \"The United States won the most medals in Tokyo,\" and the code initializes the `most_medals_winner` attribute to \"United States\" when the location is \"Tokyo,\" the conclusion is \"True.\"",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

This ensures that all relevant premises are applied.\n\n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:**\n   - After running inference, it checks if John's `arrival` is \"LGA\".\n   - If it is, the conclusion is \"True\"; otherwise, it's \"False\". If `arrival` is still `None`, the conclusion is \"Uncertain\".\n\n5. **`func` Function:**\n   - Creates instances of `Flight` for John and Susan.\n   - Calls `check_conclusion` to determine the final result.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any part of the code!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

In this case, only premise 5 is directly relevant and updates the `activates_leg_muscles` property of the `Person` object.\n\n* `run_inference`: This function repeatedly calls `apply_premises` until no further changes are made to the object states.\n\n* `check_conclusion`: This function calls `run_inference` to apply the premises and then checks the final state of the `basketball_player` object. If `is_american` remains `None`, it means the conclusion is uncertain. Otherwise, it returns \"True\" if Yuri is not American and \"False\" otherwise.\n\n\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe code returns \"**C) Uncertain**\" as the conclusion.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWhile we know Yuri does not activate his leg muscles, we cannot definitively conclude that he is not an American professional basketball player.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Otherwise, it's \"Uncertain\" because we don't know about other players in N\u00e1utico.\n\n4. **`func` Function:**\n   - Creates an `ailton` object and an empty list `nautico_players`.\n   - Calls `check_conclusion` to get the result.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other examples you'd like me to solve!",

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.
