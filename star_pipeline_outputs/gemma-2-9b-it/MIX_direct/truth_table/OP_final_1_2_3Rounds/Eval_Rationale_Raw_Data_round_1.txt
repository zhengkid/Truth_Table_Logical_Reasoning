From (5), we know M = True.\n\n2. From (4), since M is True, we can conclude that KO is suitable for a retirement fund (T = True).\n\n3. From (2), if KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation (P), then it is not suitable for a retirement fund (\u00acT). Therefore, if KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, it must be false (P = False).\n\n4. Since P = False, the conclusion \u00ac(G \u2228 P) \u2192 (\u00acS \u2227 \u00acV) becomes \u00acG \u2192 (\u00acS \u2227 \u00acV).\n\n5. We know some stocks are growth stocks (at least one G is True), so \u00acG is False.\n\n6. Since \u00acG is False, the implication \u00acG \u2192 (\u00acS \u2227 \u00acV) is True regardless of the truth value of (\u00acS \u2227 \u00acV).\n\n\nTruth Table:\n\n| G (Growth Stock) | P (Bought for rapid price appreciation) | S (Stock) | V (Price Volatility) | \u00acG | \u00ac(G \u2228 P) | \u00acS | \u00acV | \u00ac(G \u2228 P) \u2192 (\u00acS \u2227 \u00acV) |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------|---------|--------------|-------|-------------|-------|-------|------------------------------------|\n| True             | False                                    | True       | True         | False   | True           | True   | True   | True                                      |\n| True             | True                                     | True       | True         | False   | False          | True   | True   | True                                      |\n| False            | False                                    | True       | True         | True    | True           | True   | True   | True                                      |\n| False            | True                                     | True       | True         | True    | False          | True   | True   | True                                      |\n| True             | False                                    | False      | True         | False   | True           | False  | True   | True                                      |\n| True             | True                                     | False      | True         | False   | False          | False  | True   | True                                      |\n| False            | False                                    | False      | True         | True    | True           | False  | True   | True                                      |\n| False            | True                                     | False      | True         | True    | False          | False  | True   | True                                      |\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",
