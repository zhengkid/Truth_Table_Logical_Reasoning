From (5), we know KiKi is an animal.\n    2. We need to determine if KiKi barks (B) and if KiKi is a dog (D).\n    3.  Let's analyze the premises:\n        *  \u00ac(J \u2192 D):  This means there exists an animal that jumps (J) but is not a dog (D).\n        *  D \u2192 B:  If KiKi is a dog, then it barks.\n        *  J \u2192 L:  If KiKi jumps, then it has legs.\n        *  L \u2192 T:  If KiKi has legs, then it is terricolous.\n        *  \u00ac(\u00acJ \u2227 \u00acL) \u2192 (T \u2228 L):  If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then it is terricolous or has legs.\n    4. We can't definitively say KiKi is a dog or barks based on the premises alone. The premises provide information about relationships between animals, jumping, barking, and being terricolous, but they don't directly state whether KiKi possesses these traits.\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| J (KiKi jumps) | L (KiKi has legs) | T (KiKi is terricolous) | D (KiKi is a dog) | B (KiKi barks) | \u00acB \u2227 \u00acD (KiKi does not bark and is not a dog) |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------------------------------|\n| True            | True            | True                   | False         | True          | False                                |\n| True            | True            | True                   | False         | True          | False                                |\n| True            | True            | False                  | False         | True          | False                                |\n| True            | False           | True                   | False         | False         | True                                 |\n| True            | False           | False                  | False         | False         | True                                 |\n| False           | True            | True                   | False         | True          | False                                |\n| False           | True            | True                   | False         | False         | True                                 |\n| False           | True            | False                  | False         | False         | True                                 |\n| False           | False           | True                   | False         | True          | False                                |\n| False           | False           | False                  | False         | False         | True                                 |\n| False           | False           | True                   | True          | True          | False                                |\n| False           | False           | True                   | True          | False         | False                                |\n| False           | False           | False                  | True          | True          | False                                |\n| False           | False           | False                  | True          | False         | False                                |\n\n\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",
