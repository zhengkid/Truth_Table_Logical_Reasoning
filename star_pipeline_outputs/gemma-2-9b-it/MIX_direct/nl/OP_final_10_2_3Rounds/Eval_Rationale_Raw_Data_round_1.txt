This contradicts our deduction in step 3 that if someone is born in a multiple birth with siblings, they often live at home. Therefore, this possibility is unlikely.\n    - **Possibility 2:** Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. This possibility doesn't directly relate to the conclusion about complaining about siblings.\nStep 7:  The premise \"If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together\" and \"If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth\"  tell us that if someone complains about annoying siblings, they have siblings born together. \nStep 8: However, we don't have any information connecting Luke's situation to complaining about siblings.\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, based on the given premises, we cannot definitively conclude whether Luke complains often about annoying siblings.\n\n\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",
