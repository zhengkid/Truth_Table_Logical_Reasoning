From (7), we know P is True.\n2. From (2), if Rock is a monkey (M), then Rock is an animal (A).\n3. From (1), if Rock is Peter's pet and also an animal, then Rock is an animal. This doesn't give us new information.\n4. From (3), Rock is either a monkey (M) or a bird (B).\n5. From (8), Rock can fly (F), is a bird (B), or cannot breathe (\u00acD).\n6. From (6), if Rock can fly (F), then it has wings (W).\n7. From (5), if Rock is an animal (A) and is Peter's pet, then it can breathe (D).\n\nNow we need to analyze the possibilities:\n\n* **If Rock is a monkey (M):** \n    * From (2), Rock is an animal (A).\n    * From (7), Rock can breathe (D).\n    * This satisfies all premises.\n\n* **If Rock is a bird (B):**\n    * From (4), Rock is either a monkey or a bird, so this is a valid possibility.\n    * From (3), Peter's birds can fly (F).\n    * From (6), if Rock can fly (F), then it has wings (W).\n    * From (7), Rock can breathe (D).\n    * This satisfies all premises.\n\n* **If Rock cannot breathe (\u00acD):**\n    * This contradicts (7) because it states that all animals that are Peter's pets can breathe. \n    * Therefore, Rock cannot be a bird or a monkey.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities for Rock are a monkey or a bird.  We cannot definitively say whether Rock is a monkey or a bird based on the premises.\n\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

From the premise \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs,\" we know that if something is terricolous, it has legs.\n    7. From the premise \"KiKi is an animal,\" we know that KiKi is an animal.\n    8. The premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs\" tells us that if KiKi doesn't jump or have legs, then it must be terricolous or have legs.\n    9. This premise introduces a contradiction, as it states KiKi must be either terricolous or have legs, but if it's neither, it must be one or the other.\n    10. Therefore, KiKi must either jump or have legs.\n    11. Since KiKi must either jump or have legs, and if it jumps, Jane likes it, and if it has legs, it jumps, then Jane must like KiKi.\n    12. This contradicts the premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark,\" which implies that if something is a dog (and thus barks), Jane does not like it.\n    13. Therefore, KiKi cannot be a dog.\n    14. Since KiKi is not a dog, it does not bark.\n    15. Therefore, the conclusion \"KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog\" is **true**.\n\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",
