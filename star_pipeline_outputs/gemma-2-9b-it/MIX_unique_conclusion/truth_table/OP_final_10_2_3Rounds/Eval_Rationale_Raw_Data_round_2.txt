(C \u2227 K \u2192 T)\n\nLogical Chain:\n\n1. From (6): R \u2228 S \u2227 K is True. This means Rockie is either a rabbit or a squirrel and is calm.\n\n2. If Rockie is a rabbit, then from (1) it is also cute (R \u2192 C).\n\n3. If Rockie is a squirrel, then from (5) it is skittish (S \u2192 \u00acK). This contradicts (6), so Rockie cannot be a squirrel.\n\n4. Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit.\n\n5. Since Rockie is a rabbit and cute (from 2), and calm (from 6), the conclusion (C \u2227 K \u2192 T) becomes:\n   True \u2192 T\n\n6. Any statement implying a True antecedent implies its consequent, so the conclusion is True.\n\n\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",
