From (5) we know that if John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans (E \u2192 \u00acFr \u2227 \u00acP). This means if John is engaged, they cannot have a well-attended wedding (since (3) states that anyone with a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony).\n\n3. From (6) we know that if John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony (F \u2192 (W \u2228 Fr)). This means if John has a larger family, they cannot be engaged (since (2) states that if they were engaged, they couldn't have a well-attended wedding or invite friends).\n\n4. Combining (1) and (3), we see that if John has a larger family, they cannot be engaged.\n\n5.

(C \u2227 (B \u2228 Ch)) \u2192 (C \u2227 (B \u2227 F))\n\nLogical Chain:\n    From (2) and (3), we know B is a deadly disease.\n    From (1), if something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate (D \u2192 S), so B comes with a low survival rate (B \u2192 S).\n    From (6), we know C is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate (\u00ac(C \u2227 (B \u2228 F))). This implies that C cannot be both B and F.\n    From (4) and (3), if C is a kind of bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma (C \u2227 (B \u2228 Ch)), then C must be B.\n    Since C cannot be both B and F (from 6), if C is a kind of bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma, then C cannot be a kind of mild flu.\nTruth Table (Simplified):\n| C (Colorectal Cancer) | B (Bile Duct Cancer) | F (Mild Flu) | C \u2227 (B \u2228 Ch) | C \u2227 (B \u2227 F) |\n|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| ...                   | ...                  | ...         | ...         | ...         |\n| ...                   | True                | False       | True        | False       |\n| ...                   | True                | True        | True        | False       |\n| ...                   | False               | ...         | False       | False       |\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>",

From (6), we know KiKi is an animal (T).\n2. We need to determine if T is True.\n3.

We can break down the analysis based on different possibilities:\n    - **Case 1: KiKi is a dog (D):** \n        - If KiKi is a dog, then KiKi barks (B).\n        - Jane doesn't like animals that bark (\u00acB).\n        - This creates a contradiction, so KiKi cannot be a dog.\n    - **Case 2: KiKi is not a dog (\u00acD):**\n        - We need to consider the remaining premises:\n            - If KiKi has legs (L), then KiKi jumps (J).\n            - Jane likes all animals that jump (J).\n            - If KiKi is terricolous (T), then KiKi has legs (L).\n        - We need to determine if KiKi has legs (L) or is terricolous (T).\n        - The premise (6) states that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs (\u00acJ \u2227 \u00acL), then KiKi is terricolous or has legs (T \u2228 L). \n        - This means if KiKi doesn't jump and doesn't have legs, then KiKi must be terricolous or have legs.\n        - Therefore, if KiKi is not a dog and doesn't jump, then KiKi must be terricolous or have legs.\n\n5.
