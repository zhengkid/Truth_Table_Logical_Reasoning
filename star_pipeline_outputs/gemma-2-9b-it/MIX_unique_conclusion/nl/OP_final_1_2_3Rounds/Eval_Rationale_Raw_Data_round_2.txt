This means Taylor is either in one of two mutually exclusive situations:\n    * She grew up in a health-conscious home and disregards her physical well-being.\n    * She did not grow up in a health-conscious home and does not disregard her physical well-being.\n\nStep 7: From Step 5, we know that if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious home, she doesn't disregard her physical well-being. So, the first part of the disjunction is impossible.\n\nStep 8: This leaves us with the second part of the disjunction: Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious home and does not disregard her physical well-being.\n\nStep 9: We also know from Step 3 that if Taylor does not disregard her physical well-being, she eats salads regularly.\n\nStep 10: The premise \"If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes\" implies that if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.\n\nStep 11: The premise \"All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes\" means that if Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.\n\nStep 12:  We know Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious home (from Step 8), so she cannot fulfill her daily nutritional intakes (from Step 11).\n\nStep 13: Therefore, Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day (from Step 10).\n\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",
