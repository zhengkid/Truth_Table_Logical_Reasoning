Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
