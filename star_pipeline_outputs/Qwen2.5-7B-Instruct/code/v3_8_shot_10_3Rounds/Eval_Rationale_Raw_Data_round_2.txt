If someone can vote in the United States, they can join a big party for choosing a new leader (that's the presidential election).\n2. If someone is from the United States, they can vote.\n3. People are either from the United States or from Taiwan.\n4. People from Russia can't be from Taiwan.\n5. A person named Vladimir isn't from Taiwan and doesn't work for a big company.\n6. Ekaterina can either vote or work for a big company.\n\nNow, we want to know if Ekaterina can join the big party or work for the big company. From the clues, we know:\n- If Ekaterina can vote, she can join the big party.\n- If Ekaterina is from Russia, she can't be from Taiwan, so she can't work for the big company.\n- Ekaterina either can vote or works for the big company.\n\nSo, we know that Ekaterina can either join the big party or work for the big company, or both!
