Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 (Premise 7), and if she were female, she would have lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. However, we need to determine if Coco Gauff is female or male.\n\nFrom Premise 6, we know that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then she is not a male tennis player. We need to explore both possibilities.\n\n- **Case 1**: Coco Gauff is female.\n  - If Coco Gauff is female, then from Premise 3, she lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n  - From Premise 2, since she lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, she is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.\n  - From Premise 6, if she is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then she is not a male tennis player.

This creates a contradiction.\n\nSince Case 2 leads to a contradiction, Coco Gauff cannot be male. Therefore, she must be female.\n\nSince Coco Gauff is female, from Premise 3, she lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. However, we need to check if she also lost to Rafael Nadal. Since she is female and not male, the only way she could have lost to Rafael Nadal is if she lost to him directly, but this is not necessarily implied by the premises. We need to use Premise 6 again:\n\n- Premise 6 states that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then she is not a male tennis player. Since she is female, she cannot be a male tennis player, and thus, she must have lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\nTherefore, Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\n<answer>\nTrue\n</answer>",

(HB -> PT)\n5. If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book. (1984SS -> 1984HB)\n\n### Conclusion:\n1984 is printed text. (1984PT)\n\n### Truth Table Analysis:\n\nLet's represent the statements symbolically:\n- DM: 1984 is a digital media\n- A: 1984 is analog\n- PT: 1984 is printed text\n- SS: 1984 is a streaming service\n- HB: 1984 is a hardcover book\n\nGiven:\n- DM -> \u00acA\n- PT -> A\n- SS -> DM\n- HB -> PT\n- 1984SS -> 1984HB\n\nWe need to determine if 1984PT is true.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **From premise 5 (1984SS -> 1984HB):**\n   - If 1984 is a streaming service, then it is a hardcover book.\n   - Since all streaming services are digital media (premise 3), 1984SS -> DM.\n   - Combining these, we get 1984SS -> (DM and HB).\n\n2. **From premise 4 (HB -> PT):**\n   - If 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.\n   - Therefore, 1984SS -> (DM and HB) -> PT.\n\n3. **From premise 2 (PT -> A):**\n   - If 1984 is printed text, then it is analog.\n   - Therefore, 1984SS -> (DM and HB) -> PT -> A.\n\n4. **From premise 1 (DM -> \u00acA):**\n   - If 1984 is a digital media, then it is not analog.\n   - Therefore, 1984SS -> (DM and HB) -> A (contradicts DM -> \u00acA).\n\nGiven the contradiction, 1984 cannot be a streaming service. Therefore, 1984SS is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since 1984 is not a streaming service, we cannot directly conclude that 1984 is a hardcover book or printed text based on the given premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement \"1984 is printed text\" is **uncertain**.\n\n<answer>Uncertain</answer>",

Since Hannah works in student jobs on campus, she must be in one of these categories.\n- From Premise 2, if Hannah orders takeout frequently, she works in student jobs on campus. This is consistent with Premise 7.\n- From Premise 4, if Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then she is not picky eaters. We have already established that Hannah is not picky.\n- From Premise 5, if Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. Since we do not have information that she orders takeout frequently, it is reasonable to assume she enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises, we can conclude that Hannah is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\n\nThe statement \"Hannah is at Mary's school and she is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\" is true.\n\n<answer>\n(A) True\n</answer>",

However, the statement also says if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. This implies that Hannah does not need to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, meaning she does not work in student jobs on campus, which contradicts the fact that she does work in student jobs on campus. This is a contradiction, but let's proceed with the given information.\n\nFrom premise 2, if people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus. Since Hannah works in student jobs on campus, she must order takeout frequently in college (or she is in a situation where the premises are not mutually exclusive, but we will assume the logical flow).\n\nFrom premise 3, since Hannah orders takeout frequently, she must work in student jobs on campus, which we already know. This is consistent.\n\nFrom premise 4, if Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then she is not a picky eater. From premise 5, if Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the statement \"Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\" is true.\n\nGiven that Hannah works in student jobs on campus, she must order takeout frequently. This means she does not enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes. Therefore, she is not a picky eater (since if she enjoyed the dining hall meals and recipes, she would not be a picky eater, and she does not enjoy them).\n\nSo, the statement \"Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\" is true because Hannah is not a picky eater.\n\n<answer>\n(A) True\n</answer>",

Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n\nFrom premise 5, we have two cases:\n- Case 1: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers.\n- Case 2: Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n\nLet's examine each case:\n\n**Case 1: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers.**\n- From premise 1, if Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth, then he has siblings who were born together.\n- From premise 3, if Luke lives with strangers, he cannot live at home.\n- From premise 4, if Luke does not live at home, he cannot spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n- From premise 2, if Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, he cannot complain often about annoying siblings.\n\n**Case 2: Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.**\n- From premise 1, if Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth, then he does not have siblings who were born together.\n- From premise 2, if Luke does not have siblings who were born together, he cannot complain often about annoying siblings.\n\nIn both cases, we conclude that Luke cannot complain often about annoying siblings. Therefore, the statement \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings\" is false.\n\n<answer>\nFalse\n</answer>",

        "rationale": "To analyze the given premises and determine the truth of the statement about Luke, we need to consider the logical implications step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\n2. **Premise 2**: If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\n3. **Premise 3**: If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.\n4. **Premise 4**: If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\n5. **Premise 5**: If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home.\n6. **Premise 6**: Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n\nFrom Premise 6, we can deduce the following:\n- If Luke is born in a multiple birth, then he must live with strangers.\n- If Luke is not born in a multiple birth, then he must not live with strangers.\n\nLet's analyze the implications for each case:\n\n### Case 1: Luke is born in a multiple birth\n- According to Premise 2, if Luke is born in a multiple birth, he has siblings who were born together.\n- According to Premise 3, if Luke has siblings who were born together, he complains often about annoying siblings.\n- According to Premise 1, if Luke has siblings who were born together, he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n- According to Premise 5, if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, he often lives at home.\n- According to Premise 4, if Luke lives at home, he does not live with strangers.\n\nThis creates a contradiction because if Luke is born in a multiple birth, he must live with strangers (from Premise 6), but he cannot live with strangers if he lives at home (from Premise 4 and Premise 5).\n\n### Case 2: Luke is not born in a multiple birth\n- According to Premise 6, if Luke is not born in a multiple birth, he does not live with strangers.\n- According to Premise 4, if Luke does not live with strangers, he often lives at home.\n- According to Premise 5, if Luke often lives at home, he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n- According to Premise 1, if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, he is not born in a multiple birth (this is consistent with the assumption).\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that Luke cannot be born in a multiple birth because it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Luke must not be born in a multiple birth.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the statement: \"complains often about annoying siblings.\"\n- If Luke is not born in a multiple birth, according to Premise 3, he does not have siblings who were born together.\n- If Luke does not have siblings who were born together, he does not complain often about annoying siblings.\n\nTherefore, Luke does not complain often about annoying siblings.\n\n### Conclusion\nLuke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.\n\nThe statement is true.\n\n<answer>(A) True</answer>",

        "rationale": "Let's break down the premises and see what we can deduce about Peter.\n\n1. If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.\n2. All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\n3. If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\n4. If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\n5. All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.\n6. Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.\n\nFrom premises 3 and 4, we can infer:\n- If people are cleanly, then they value order and spotlessness.\n- If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\n\nFrom premise 5, we can infer:\n- If a person's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then the person values order and spotlessness.\n- Since a person who values order and spotlessness is cleanly, people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness are also cleanly.\n\nNow, let's analyze Peter's situation based on premise 6:\n- If Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, then by premise 1, he is not notably tidy, and by premise 3, he is notably tidy (which is a contradiction). Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n- If Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly, then he is notably tidy (from premise 1) and is not notably tidy (which is a contradiction). Therefore, this scenario is also impossible.\n\nSince both scenarios lead to contradictions, Peter must be in a state where he is not cleanly and spills a lot of food on his clothing, or he is cleanly and does not spill a lot of food on his clothing. However, we can't determine the specific state he is in based on the given information.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n- Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try spills a lot of food on their clothing. Therefore, if Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, he must spill a lot of food on his clothing. Since we have established that Peter cannot be both cleanly and spill a lot of food on his clothing, he cannot be a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try if he is cleanly.\n\nSimilarly, if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, he values order and spotlessness and is therefore cleanly. Since we have established that Peter cannot be cleanly and spill a lot of food on his clothing, he cannot have a family that prioritizes order and spotlessness if he spills a lot of food on his clothing.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe statement is true.\n\n<answer>A</answer>",

Jane does not like any animals that bark.\n2. All dogs are animals that bark.\n3. Jane likes all animals that jump.\n4. If an animal has legs, then it jumps.\n5. If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.\n6. KiKi is an animal.\n7. If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n\nLet's analyze the implications of these premises:\n\n- From premise 1 and 2, we know that dogs are animals that Jane does not like.\n- From premise 3, Jane likes all animals that jump.\n- From premise 4, if an animal has legs, it jumps.\n- From premise 5, if an animal is terricolous, it has legs.\n- Premise 6 states that KiKi is an animal.\n- Premise 7 states that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n\nTo determine if KiKi is terricolous, we need to consider the conditions under which KiKi would be terricolous according to premise 7. KiKi would be terricolous if it does not jump and does not have legs. However, if KiKi does not have legs, it cannot be terricolous because premise 5 states that if an animal is terricolous, it has legs. Therefore, the only way for KiKi to be terricolous is if it neither jumps nor has legs.\n\nSince we do not have any information that directly states whether KiKi jumps or has legs, we cannot definitively conclude whether KiKi is terricolous or not based on the given premises. The statement \"KiKi is terricolous\" is uncertain because it depends on the unspecified conditions of whether KiKi jumps or has legs.\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\n(C) Uncertain\n</answer>",

        "rationale": "Let's analyze the premises step by step to determine if KiKi can be a barking dog.\n\n1. Jane does not like any animals that bark.\n2. All dogs are animals that bark.\n3. Jane likes all animals that jump.\n4. If an animal has legs, then it jumps.\n5. If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.\n6. KiKi is an animal.\n7. If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n\nFrom premises 1 and 2, we can infer that Jane does not like any dogs because all dogs bark.\n\nPremise 3 states that Jane likes all animals that jump. However, this does not provide any direct information about KiKi.\n\nPremise 4 tells us that if an animal has legs, it jumps. Premise 5 states that if an animal is terricolous, it has legs. This means that if an animal is terricolous, it jumps (since it has legs and if it has legs, it jumps).\n\nPremise 6 confirms that KiKi is an animal.\n\nPremise 7 states that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. This implies that KiKi must either jump or have legs (or both).\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"KiKi is a barking dog.\" For KiKi to be a barking dog, it must be a dog and bark. According to premise 2, all dogs bark. Therefore, for KiKi to be a barking dog, it must be a dog.\n\nHowever, if KiKi is a barking dog, it must bark. According to premise 1, Jane does not like any animals that bark. Since Jane likes all animals that jump (premise 3), and if an animal has legs, it jumps (premise 4), it means that if KiKi is a barking dog, it must have legs to jump. But if KiKi has legs, it must jump (premise 4), which means Jane would like it (premise 3). This creates a contradiction because if KiKi is a barking dog, it would both bark (and therefore Jane would not like it) and have legs (and therefore Jane would like it).\n\nTherefore, KiKi cannot be a barking dog.\n\n<answer>\nFalse\n</answer>",
