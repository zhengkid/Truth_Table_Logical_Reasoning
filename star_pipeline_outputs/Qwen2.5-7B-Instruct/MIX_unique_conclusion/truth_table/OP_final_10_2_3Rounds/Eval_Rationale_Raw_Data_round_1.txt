This means if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she cannot be a student who attends the school.\n\nSince Bonnie cannot be both a student who attends the school and not a student who attends the school, she must be an engaged student. Therefore, she must perform in school talent shows often.\n\nThus, the statement \"Bonnie performs in school talent shows often\" is true.\n\n<answer>\n(A) True\n</answer>",

If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.\n   - This is a conditional statement. If the game meets the condition (selling more than one million copies), then it will be on the Top 10 list.\n\n4. The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.\n   - This is a fact that satisfies the condition in premise 3.\n\nNow, let's construct a truth table to evaluate the logical implications:\n\n| Game Sales (S) | Top 10 List (T) | Japanese Company (J) |\n|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| True           | True            | True                 |\n| True           | False           | True                 |\n| False          | False           | True                 |\n| True           | True            | False                |\n| True           | False           | False                |\n| False          | False           | False                |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that if a game sells more than one million copies (S = True), then it will be included in the Top 10 list (T = True), regardless of whether it is made by a Japanese company (J).\n\nGiven the premises, we can conclude that The Legend of Zelda, which sold more than one million copies, must be on the Top 10 list.\n\n<answer>A</answer>",

No digital media are analog. (Therefore, \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\))\n2. Every printed text is analog media. (Therefore, \\( R \\rightarrow S \\))\n3. All streaming services are digital media. (Therefore, \\( P \\rightarrow T \\))\n4. If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text. (Therefore, \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\))\n5. If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book. (Therefore, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\))\n\nWe need to determine the truth value of \\( P \\).\n\nFrom premise 5, we have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).

From premise 5, Ted is an alligator, and therefore, not a domesticated animal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios for Ted:\n\n- If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle (B), then:\n  - By premise 1, Ted is a cow.\n  - By premise 3, all cows are domesticated animals.\n  - By premise 4, alligators are not domesticated animals, and since Ted is an alligator, this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, Ted cannot be a Brown Swiss cattle if he is an alligator (as per premise 5).\n\nSince Ted cannot be both a Brown Swiss cattle and an alligator, the premise \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is vacuously true because \\( B \\) is false (Ted cannot be a Brown Swiss cattle).\n\nThus, the statement \"If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet\" is true.\n\n<answer>\n(A) True\n</answer>",

        "rationale": "To determine if the statement \"Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa\" is true, false, or uncertain, let's analyze the premises step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: No baked sweets are spicy.\n   - This means if something is a baked sweet, it cannot be spicy.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: All cupcakes are baked sweets.\n   - Therefore, all cupcakes cannot be spicy.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: All mala hotpots are spicy.\n   - This means if something is a mala hotpot, it must be spicy.\n\n4. **Premise 4**: All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.\n   - Therefore, all products from Baked by Melissa are baked sweets and cannot be spicy.\n\n5. **Premise 5**: Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.\n   - This means dried Thai chilies can be one of three things: spicy, mala hotpot, or not a baked sweet.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- If dried Thai chilies were spicy, they could either be mala hotpots (which are spicy) or not baked sweets.\n- If dried Thai chilies were not baked sweets, they would not be cupcakes and therefore not products of Baked by Melissa.\n- If dried Thai chilies were mala hotpots, they would be spicy, but mala hotpots are a specific type of food, not necessarily related to Baked by Melissa's products.\n\nGiven that the only way dried Thai chilies could be associated with Baked by Melissa is if they were not baked sweets, and since dried Thai chilies are described as being spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets, it is possible for them to be not baked sweets. However, this does not directly imply that they are products of Baked by Melissa.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot definitively conclude that dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa.\n\n<answer>\n(C) Uncertain\n</answer>",

Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.\n2. If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.\n3. The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.\n4. All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.\n5. Breaking Bad is a show.\n6. Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n\nFrom these premises, we can construct a logical flow:\n\n- If a show gives out roses on TV (Premise 1), then it must be an episode of The Bachelor (Premise 2).\n- The Bachelor is a show that portrays the lives of real people (Premises 3 and 4).\n- Therefore, if a show gives out roses on TV, it must be an episode of The Bachelor, and not Breaking Bad (since Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show).\n\nGiven the above, if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, it would contradict the premises because Breaking Bad cannot be an episode of The Bachelor. Hence, it is impossible for roses to be given out during Breaking Bad.\n\nThus, the statement \"If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm\" is always false because the antecedent (roses given out during Breaking Bad) is impossible.\n\n<answer>\n(B) False\n</answer>",

Therefore, Taylor cannot have grown up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregarded her physical well-being.\n\nThis means that Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home or did not disregard her physical well-being, or both.

This contradicts the assumption that she did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home.\n\nSince both cases lead to a contradiction, the only consistent scenario is that Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home and did not disregard her physical well-being.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day.\n\n<answer>\nFalse\n</answer>",

For KiKi to be a barking dog, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n- KiKi must be a dog.\n- KiKi must bark.\n\nFrom Premise 2, all dogs are animals that bark. Therefore, for KiKi to be a barking dog, KiKi must be a dog.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditions under which KiKi could be a dog:\n- From Premise 4, if an animal has legs, then it jumps.\n- From Premise 5, if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.\n- From Premise 7, if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios for KiKi:\n- **Scenario 1:** KiKi jumps.\n  - From Premise 4, if KiKi jumps, then KiKi has legs.\n  - From Premise 5, if KiKi has legs, then KiKi is terricolous.\n  - From Premise 7, if KiKi jumps, then the condition \"KiKi neither jumps nor has legs\" is false, so the conclusion \"KiKi is terricolous or has legs\" is true, which is consistent with our previous deductions.\n- **Scenario 2:** KiKi does not jump.\n  - From Premise 7, if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n  - If KiKi has legs, then from Premise 4, KiKi jumps, which contradicts the assumption that KiKi does not jump. Therefore, KiKi cannot have legs.\n  - If KiKi is terricolous, then from Premise 5, KiKi has legs, which again contradicts the assumption that KiKi does not have legs. Therefore, KiKi cannot be terricolous.\n  - This scenario leads to a contradiction, so KiKi cannot be in this state.\n\nFrom the analysis, the only consistent scenario is that KiKi jumps and has legs. Since all dogs bark and KiKi must be a dog to be a barking dog, we need to check if KiKi is a dog:\n- If KiKi jumps and has legs, then KiKi is a dog (from the consistency of the premises).\n\nTherefore, KiKi is a barking dog.\n\n<answer>True</answer>",
