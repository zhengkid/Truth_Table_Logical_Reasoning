Therefore, Harry cannot be both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone.\n   - If Harry is neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, he must be an invertebrate (since he cannot be a vertebrate).\n   - Since Harry is an invertebrate, he cannot be a queen bee (as all bees are invertebrates, but not all invertebrates are queen bees).\n\n4. **Final Analysis:**\n   - The statement \"If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee\" is logically consistent with the premises.\n   - If Harry is both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, he would not be an invertebrate, and if he is neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, he would be an invertebrate and not a queen bee.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n<answer>\n(A) True\n</answer>",

We know from Premise 4 that some people who have well-attended weddings have larger families. However, this does not necessarily mean that John, specifically, has a larger family.\n\nSince we do not have any direct information about John's status (engaged, well-attended wedding, or inviting friends) that would definitively link him to having a larger family, we cannot conclude with certainty whether John has a larger family or not.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"John has a larger family\" is uncertain based on the given premises.\n\n<answer>\n(C) Uncertain\n</answer>",

All animal lovers are nice to animals.\n4. All pet owners love animals.\n5. Tom is a pet owner.\n\nFrom premise 3 and 4, we can infer that all pet owners are nice to animals. This is because all pet owners love animals, and all animal lovers are nice to animals.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement: \"If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.\"\n\nWe need to break this down into two parts:\n1. If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals.\n2. Then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that some grumpy people are mean to animals. This means that it is possible for a grumpy person to be mean to animals. However, premise 1 states that no one who is nice to animals is also mean to animals. Since all pet owners are nice to animals (from premises 3 and 4), it follows that Tom cannot be both a pet owner and mean to animals.\n\nGiven that Tom is a pet owner, he must be nice to animals. Therefore, if Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, he cannot be a grumpy person (since being grumpy and mean to animals would contradict being nice to animals as a pet owner).\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the statement: \"Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.\"\n\nSince Tom is a pet owner, he is nice to animals and an animal lover. Therefore, the statement \"Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover\" is false.\n\nThus, the statement \"If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover\" is false.\n\n<answer>\n(B) False\n</answer>",

Therefore, if an animal is terricolous, Jane likes it.\n\nPremise 6 states that KiKi is an animal. We need to determine if KiKi is a barking dog.\n\nPremise 7 states that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. This implies that if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then KiKi must be terricolous or have legs. However, this does not provide any direct information about whether KiKi barks or is a dog.\n\nGiven the premises, we cannot definitively conclude that KiKi is a barking dog. We know that if KiKi is a dog, it would bark, but we do not have enough information to confirm that KiKi is a dog.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"KiKi is a barking dog\" is uncertain based on the given premises.\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\n(C) Uncertain\n</answer>",
