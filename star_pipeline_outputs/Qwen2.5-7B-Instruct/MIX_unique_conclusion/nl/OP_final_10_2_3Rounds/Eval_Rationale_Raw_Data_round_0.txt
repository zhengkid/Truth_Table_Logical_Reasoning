        "rationale": "Step 1: Analyze Bonnie's membership status in the club. According to the premise \"Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school,\" we know Bonnie falls into one of two categories:\n- Category 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, and is a student who attends the school.\n- Category 2: Bonnie does not attend and is not very engaged with school events, and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate Bonnie's potential performance in school talent shows. The premise states \"People in this club who perform in school talent shows often are very engaged with school events.\" If Bonnie falls into Category 1, she is very engaged with school events and, therefore, likely performs in school talent shows often.\n\nStep 3: Consider the other category. If Bonnie falls into Category 2, the premise \"People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members\" indicates that Bonnie does not perform in school talent shows often, as she is described as inactive and disinterested.\n\nStep 4: Examine the additional premises about chaperoning high school dances and academic aspirations. These premises do not directly influence whether Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, but they help in understanding the context of the club's activities.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the given information. Since Bonnie's membership status can either lead to her performing in school talent shows often (Category 1) or not (Category 2), we cannot definitively state whether Bonnie performs in school talent shows often based solely on the provided premises.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

Therefore, if James is a manager, he cannot have lunch at home.\n- If James is in other countries (O countries), he works remotely from home (R home). If he has lunch at home (L home), he would also work remotely from home (R home), which means he is in other countries and works remotely from home.\n\nStep 6: The conclusion and its contrapositive are logically consistent with the premises.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

However, from Premise 1, we know that Zaha Hadid's designs that Max adores have interesting geometries. Therefore, if a design by Max that he adores is a brutalist building, it must be a Zaha Hadid design and also evocative (from Premise 4 and Premise 5).\n\nStep 3: Check for any contradictions or additional inferences.\n\n- Premise 3 states that every style Max adores is either a Zaha Hadid design or a Kelly Wearstler design. If a design is a brutalist building, it cannot be a Kelly Wearstler design because Kelly Wearstler's designs that Max adores are evocative and dreamy (Premises 4 and 5), and brutalist buildings that Max adores do not have interesting geometries (Premise 2), which contradicts the statement that all brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries (from Premise 1 and the conditional statement in Premise 6).\n\nStep 4: Conclude based on the analysis.\n\n- The only way a brutalist building can be adored by Max is if it is a Zaha Hadid design and evocative (from Premise 6 and the other premises). However, this is a contradiction because brutalist buildings that Max adores do not have interesting geometries (Premise 2), and all Zaha Hadid designs that Max adores have interesting geometries (Premise 1).\n\nSince there is a logical contradiction in the premises, we cannot definitively conclude that a design by Max is a brutalist building.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

        "rationale": "Step 1: Identify the relationships given in the premises.\n- Premise 1: No digital media are analog. This means digital media and analog media are mutually exclusive categories.\n- Premise 2: Every printed text is analog media. This means all printed texts fall under the analog category.\n- Premise 3: All streaming services are digital media. This means if something is a streaming service, it must be digital media.\n- Premise 4: If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text. This establishes a conditional relationship where hardcover books are a subset of printed texts, and thus, analog media.\n- Premise 5: If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book. This establishes another conditional relationship involving 1984.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of the premises.\n- From Premise 3, if 1984 were a streaming service, it would be digital media.\n- From Premise 1, since digital media and analog media are mutually exclusive, 1984 could not be analog if it were a streaming service.\n- From Premise 2 and Premise 4, if 1984 were a hardcover book, it would be analog.\n- From Premise 5, if 1984 were a streaming service, it would be a hardcover book, which would make it analog.\n- Combining the implications from Premise 3 and Premise 5, if 1984 were a streaming service, it would be both digital and analog, which contradicts Premise 1.\n\nStep 3: Conclude based on the analysis.\n- The only way to avoid the contradiction is if 1984 is not a streaming service. If 1984 were a streaming service, it would be digital media, and since digital media and analog media are mutually exclusive, it cannot be analog. However, if it were a hardcover book (and thus analog), it would fall under the mutually exclusive categories, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, 1984 cannot be a streaming service.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

        "rationale": "Step 1: From the premises, we can derive the following logical connections:\n- If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition. (P1)\n- If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus. (P2)\n- People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes. (P3)\n- If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters. (P4)\n- If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. (P5)\n\nStep 2: For Hannah, we have the additional premises:\n- Hannah is at Mary's school. (H1)\n- Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. (H2)\n\nStep 3: From P1 and H2, we can infer that Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, because if she did not need to earn money, she would not be working in student jobs. Therefore, we can conclude:\n- Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. (H3)\n\nStep 4: From H3 and P1, we can deduce:\n- Hannah works in student jobs on campus. (H4, which is already given in H2)\n\nStep 5: From H4 and P2, we can infer:\n- Hannah orders takeout frequently in college. (H5)\n\nStep 6: From H5 and P3, we can conclude:\n- People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, which includes Hannah. Therefore, we can infer:\n- Hannah either enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes or orders takeout frequently. (H6)\n\nStep 7: From H6 and P4, we can derive:\n- If Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, she is not a picky eater. (H7)\n\nStep 8: From H6 and P5, we can derive:\n- If Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. (H8)\n\nStep 9: Combining H7 and H8, we have two possibilities for Hannah:\n- Either she is not a picky eater, or if she is a picky eater, she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. (H9)\n\nStep 10: Since H1 (Hannah is at Mary's school) is given and H9 is derived from the premises, the statement \"Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\" is true based on the logical connections derived from the premises.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

        "conclusions": "The Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service.",
        "rationale": "Step 1: From the premise \"All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations,\" and the premise \"The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents,\" we can infer that if The Hamden Plaza Subway store is not popular among local residents, it must be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations because it has a rating greater than four.\nStep 2: From the premise \"If a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews,\" and the inference from Step 1, we can deduce that if The Hamden Plaza Subway store is not popular among local residents, it has not received many negative reviews.\nStep 3: From the premise \"Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews,\" we understand that there exists at least one restaurant that does not provide take-out service and has received many negative reviews. This does not directly apply to The Hamden Plaza Subway store, as we are not given information about whether it provides take-out service or not.\nStep 4: To determine if The Hamden Plaza Subway store does not provide take-out service, we need to consider the logical possibilities:\n   - If The Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents, it has a rating greater than four (from the premise \"All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four\"). Since it has a rating greater than four, it is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations and does not have many negative reviews. However, this does not provide information about its take-out service.\n   - If The Hamden Plaza Subway store is not popular among local residents, it must be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations and does not have many negative reviews (from Step 1 and Step 2). This still does not provide direct information about its take-out service.\nStep 5: Given the premises, there is no direct logical link that allows us to conclude whether The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service or not. The premises do not provide enough information to definitively state that it does not provide take-out service.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, the statement \"The Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service\" is uncertain.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

        "rationale": "Step 1: From the premise \"Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates,\" we know that Harry, being an animal, must be either an invertebrate or a vertebrate. \n\nStep 2: The premise \"All vertebrate animals have a backbone\" and \"All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating\" imply that if Harry is a vertebrate, he has a backbone and reproduces by male-and-female mating.\n\nStep 3: The premise \"All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating\" directly contradicts the reproduction method of vertebrate animals. Therefore, if Harry is a bee, he cannot be a vertebrate.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"All queen bees are bees\" means that if Harry is a queen bee, he is a bee. From Step 3, we know that if Harry is a bee, he cannot be a vertebrate, so Harry cannot be a queen bee and a vertebrate simultaneously.\n\nStep 5: The conclusion states \"If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.\" We need to analyze this statement based on the given premises.\n\nStep 6: If Harry is a vertebrate and has a backbone, from Step 2, he would be a vertebrate and reproduce by male-and-female mating. But from Step 3, we know that all bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating, so Harry cannot be a bee if he is a vertebrate and has a backbone. Since Harry is a bee (from the premise \"Harry is a bee\"), he cannot be a vertebrate with a backbone.\n\nStep 7: If Harry is neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, he must be an invertebrate (from Step 1). However, the conclusion states \"Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.\" This means that if Harry is an invertebrate, he cannot be a queen bee. Since we know Harry is a bee (from the premise \"Harry is a bee\"), and all bees are either vertebrates or invertebrates, Harry cannot be a queen bee if he is an invertebrate.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, in both cases (whether Harry is a vertebrate with a backbone or not), the conclusion holds true. If Harry is a vertebrate with a backbone, he cannot be a queen bee. If Harry is not a vertebrate and has no backbone, he must be an invertebrate, and he cannot be a queen bee.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

We need to analyze the implications of these two cases.\n\nCase 1: Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly.\n- According to Premise 1, if Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, he is not notably tidy.\n- According to Premise 3, if Peter is cleanly, he is notably tidy.\n- These two statements are contradictory. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.\n\nCase 2: Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.\n- According to Premise 1, if Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing, he could be notably tidy or not notably tidy.\n- According to Premise 3, if Peter is not cleanly, he is not notably tidy.\n- Therefore, Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not notably tidy.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's see if Peter can be a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.\n\n- Premise 2 states that all clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\n- From our analysis, Peter cannot be a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing, so Peter cannot be a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try.\n\n- Premise 5 states that all people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.\n- Premise 4 states that if people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\n- From our analysis, Peter is not cleanly, so he cannot be someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.\n\nStep 4: Since Peter cannot be a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and he cannot be someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, the statement is false.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>",

Since the mine is indeed a donated mine, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas. Therefore, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico.\n\nStep 6: Since the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico and Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains, it follows that Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

        "conclusions": "Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class.",
        "rationale": "Step 1: Given the premise \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting,\" and knowing that \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting,\" we can infer that Michael is taller than everyone who can be blocked by him, which includes all the men in his class who do not jump when shooting.\n\nStep 2: From the premise \"Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class,\" we know that Michael is taller than all the men in his class.\n\nStep 3: The premise \"Peter is a man who is taller than Michael\" contradicts the information that Michael is taller than everyone in his class. This contradiction suggests that the statement \"Peter is a man who is taller than Michael\" cannot be true if Michael is taller than everyone in his class.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z\" (transitive property of height) does not help us directly determine the relationship between Peter and any man in Michael's class. However, it confirms that if we establish a height relationship, it must hold consistently.\n\nStep 5: The premise \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting\" implies that Windy is either taller than Michael or can jump when shooting, or both. Since we know Michael can block shooting only if the shooter does not jump, Windy must be taller than Michael or a great shooter who can jump.\n\nStep 6: Given that Peter is taller than Michael, and Michael is taller than everyone in his class, the only way Peter can be shorter than a man in Michael's class is if there is a man in Michael's class who is taller than both Michael and Peter. However, the premises do not provide any information that directly supports the existence of such a man.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, based on the given premises, we cannot definitively conclude that Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class. The information provided does not give us enough to determine the height relationship between Peter and any specific man in Michael's class.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

Since making wedding plans is a prerequisite for having a well-attended wedding (from Premise 3 and Premise 2), if John is engaged, he cannot have a well-attended wedding.\n- From Premise 6, if John has a larger family, then either he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. Since John does not invite friends to their ceremony if he is engaged (from Premise 5), and he cannot have a well-attended wedding if he is engaged (from the reasoning above), it follows that John cannot have a larger family if he is engaged.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility that John is not engaged.\n- If John is not engaged, then the premises do not provide any direct information about his wedding plans, invitations, or the attendance of his wedding. Premise 4 states that some people with well-attended weddings have larger families, but it does not provide a definitive link for John specifically. Without additional information about John\u2019s engagement status, we cannot determine whether he has a larger family or not based on the given premises.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.\n- Given the premises, we cannot definitively conclude whether John has a larger family or not.

If John has a well-attended wedding, he invites others to his ceremony (Step 3), and by the first premise, he must make wedding plans and thus is engaged. If John has a larger family, he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends (Step 6).

Therefore, if John has a larger family, he must have a well-attended wedding, leading him to be engaged.\n\nStep 8: The only way to resolve the apparent contradiction without making any of the premises false is to conclude that John must be engaged.

This means, based on Premise 1, children can watch it without guidance from parents.\n\nStep 4: If \"Hachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\" is appropriate for people of all ages (which can be true even if it is not a family-friendly animated film), then from Premise 1, children can watch it without guidance from parents.\n\nStep 5: From Premise 2, if a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents. Therefore, if \"Hachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\" does not contain excessive erotic and violent content, it would still need to be either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages for children to watch it without guidance from parents.\n\nStep 6: Given the above analysis, \"Hachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\" must either be a family-friendly animated film, be appropriate for people of all ages, or contain excessive erotic and violent content. This means it either is in the \"Frozen\" series (if it is a family-friendly animated film), or contains excessive erotic and violent content, or both.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series or both is true.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

This means we have two scenarios to consider:\n  1. \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is a family-friendly animated film.\n  2. \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is appropriate for people of all ages (regardless of whether it is a family-friendly animated film or not).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion.\n- The conclusion states: \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the \"Frozen\" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the \"Frozen\" series.\n- Let's break this down:\n  - If \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content, then from Premise 2, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.\n  - If \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is in the \"Frozen\" series, then it is a family-friendly animated film (from Premise 5).\n\nStep 4: Consider the scenarios for \"Hachi: A dog's Tale.\"\n- If \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is a family-friendly animated film, then it is rated General Audience and is appropriate for people of all ages. This means children can watch it without guidance, contradicting the statement that it contains excessive erotic and violent content.\n- If \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is appropriate for people of all ages, it does not necessarily mean it is a family-friendly animated film, but it must be rated General Audience. This also means children can watch it without guidance, again contradicting the statement that it contains excessive erotic and violent content.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the analysis.\n- Since \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" being a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages does not align with it containing excessive erotic and violent content, the statement \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the \"Frozen\" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the \"Frozen\" series, is true.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

Therefore, if George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose.\n\nStep 3: Consider the conclusion: \"If George will not compose, George can not compose.\"\n- This statement can be rephrased as: If George does not compose, then he cannot compose.\n- This is logically equivalent to saying that if George will compose, then he can compose (contrapositive).\n\nStep 4: Validate the conclusion based on the derived conditions.\n- From the premises, if George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose. This means that if George will not compose, then at least one of the conditions (can compose and wants to compose) must not be met.\n- If George will not compose, it must be that he either cannot compose or does not want to compose (or both).\n\nStep 5: Check if the conclusion logically follows.\n- The conclusion \"If George will not compose, George can not compose\" is not necessarily true based on the premises.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

However, for Taylor to be very conscious about her health and eating habits, she must eat salads regularly based on the premise \"All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\" But since Scenario 2 excludes the condition that she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, we cannot confirm this directly.\n\nStep 4: Since Scenario 1 leads to a contradiction and Scenario 2 does not provide direct evidence for Taylor eating salads regularly, we cannot definitively conclude that Taylor eats salads regularly.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

        "rationale": "Step 1: We start by examining the premises given about KiKi. The first step is to determine what we can deduce about KiKi's characteristics based on the premises.\n\nStep 2: Premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\" This can be rephrased using the logical equivalence of implication: If KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then KiKi must be terricolous or have legs. This is a tautology in itself, as it states that if a condition (neither jumping nor having legs) is true, then the consequence (being terricolous or having legs) must also be true. \n\nStep 3: We need to determine if KiKi can be terricolous. To do this, we need to consider the conditions under which KiKi could be terricolous.\n\nStep 4: Premise \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.\" This means that if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi must have legs.\n\nStep 5: Premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump.\" Since Jane does not like any animals that bark (premise 1), and all dogs bark (premise 2), it follows that Jane does not like dogs. However, this information does not directly help us determine whether KiKi is terricolous.\n\nStep 6: Premise \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps.\" This means that any animal with legs will jump. If KiKi has legs, then KiKi will jump. \n\nStep 7: Premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark.\" Since all dogs are animals that bark, Jane does not like dogs. However, this does not provide information about KiKi being a dog or not.\n\nStep 8: Since KiKi is an animal, and we need to determine if KiKi is terricolous, we use the premise that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs (premise 4). Therefore, to be terricolous, KiKi must have legs. \n\nStep 9: We now use the premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\" If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then it must be terricolous or have legs. Since we need to prove that KiKi is terricolous, we need to consider the condition where KiKi has legs. \n\nStep 10: If KiKi has legs, it must jump (premise 5). Therefore, the condition \"neither jumps nor has legs\" cannot be true for KiKi. This means that the only way for the premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs\" to hold true is if KiKi is terricolous.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, based on the premises, KiKi must be terricolous.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

However, if KiKi does have legs, it will jump, and if it jumps, it cannot be a barking dog since Jane does not like any animals that bark and likes all animals that jump, meaning it cannot be both a barking dog and one that Jane likes.\n\nStep 6: Given the information, we cannot definitively determine whether KiKi is a dog or not, or whether KiKi barks or not, without additional premises. \n\nStep 7: Since we cannot definitively determine if KiKi is a barking dog based on the given premises, the statement is uncertain.\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
