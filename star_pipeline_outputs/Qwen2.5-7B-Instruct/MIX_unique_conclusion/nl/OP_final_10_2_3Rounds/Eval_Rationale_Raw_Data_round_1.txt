Let's consider both cases:\n     - If Marvin is from Earth, he is a human (from the premise \"All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans\").\n     - If Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars, then the statement \"Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither\" holds true.\n\n3. **Examine the Implications:**\n   - If Marvin is from Earth, he is a human.\n   - If Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars, we need to check the other premises:\n     - If Marvin is not from Earth, then he is an extraterrestrial (from the premise \"If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial\").\n     - Since no extraterrestrials are human, Marvin cannot be an extraterrestrial and a human at the same time.\n     - Therefore, Marvin cannot be from neither Earth nor Mars if he is a human.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Marvin cannot be from neither Earth nor Mars because if he is from Earth, he is a human, and if he is from neither, he would be an extraterrestrial and not a human.\n   - Therefore, Marvin must be from Earth and a human.\n\n5. **Check the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion states: \"Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars.\"\n   - From our analysis, Marvin is a human and either from Earth or from Mars (or both), so he cannot be neither a human nor from Mars.\n\nFinal Answer: The statement \"Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars\" is false.\n\n<answer>\n(B) False\n</answer>",

Therefore, all players who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek must be female.\n- If Coco Gauff is a female player at Roland Garros 2022 (since she is at the tournament and all female players lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek), she must be ranked highly by the WTA (Premise 2).\n- According to Premise 6, if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA, she cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Since Coco Gauff is at the tournament, she must be a female player.\n- Since all male players lost to Rafael Nadal (Premise 5), and Coco Gauff is a female player, she could not have lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, Coco Gauff cannot have lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\n<answer>\nThe statement \"Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal\" is false.\n</answer>",

From premise 1, we know that digital media cannot be analog media. Premise 2 states that all printed text is analog media. Therefore, if 1984 were a streaming service, it would have to be digital media and analog media at the same time, which contradicts premise 1.\n\nPremise 5 states that if 1984 is a streaming service, then it is also a hardcover book. According to premise 4, if 1984 is a hardcover book, then it must be printed text. Since all printed text is analog media (premise 2), if 1984 were a hardcover book, it would also be analog media.\n\nCombining the information from premises 3 and 5, if 1984 were a streaming service, it would be both digital media and analog media, which is impossible.

Since we have clear information that Badults piloted on BBC Three, we can infer that members of Pappy's have starred in a show that piloted on BBC Three.\n   - There is no information provided about members of Pappy's starring in a show that piloted on BBC Two.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The statement claims that no members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three. However, we know from the premises that members of Pappy's have starred in a show (Badults) that piloted on BBC Three.\n   - Therefore, the statement is false because it incorrectly claims that no members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Three.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement is false.\n\n<answer>False</answer>",

This means KO is suitable for a retirement fund.\n\nFrom Premise 2, if a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, it is not suitable for a retirement fund. Therefore, for KO to be suitable for a retirement fund, it cannot be bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.\n\nFrom Premise 1, all growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. Therefore, if KO were a growth stock, it would not be suitable for a retirement fund, which contradicts Premise 4. Hence, KO cannot be a growth stock.\n\nSince KO is not a growth stock, it must be a different type of stock. The only information we have about KO is that it is a mature stock and is suitable for a retirement fund.

Therefore, KO cannot be a growth stock.\n\nGiven the analysis, KO cannot be both a growth stock and suitable for a retirement fund because being a growth stock would make it unsuitable for a retirement fund.\n\nThus, the statement \"KO is a stock and a growth stock\" is false.\n\n<answer>\n(B) False\n</answer>",

However, this conflicts with the second part of Premise 7, which states that if she needs to earn money, she is neither picky nor needs to earn money. This suggests a contradiction in the information provided, but we should still consider the logical implications.\n\nFrom Premise 4, if Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then she is not a picky eater. Since we have no direct evidence that she enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, we cannot conclude that she is not a picky eater based on the given information.\n\nFrom Premise 5, if Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. Again, we have no direct evidence that she enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, so we cannot conclude this either.\n\nGiven the premises, we can only definitively conclude that Hannah is at Mary's school and works in student jobs on campus. We cannot definitively conclude that she is not a picky eater or that she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\n\nTherefore, the statement is uncertain.\n\n<answer>\n(C) Uncertain\n</answer>",

If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\n6. Hannah is at Mary's school.\n7. Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know Hannah is at Mary's school. From premise 7, we know Hannah works in student jobs on campus. According to premise 2, if people work in student jobs on campus, they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition. Therefore, Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n\nNow, according to premise 1, if Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, she is working in student jobs on campus, which we already know is true. The statement \"if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition\" is a contradiction because it implies she does not need to earn money, which we know is false. This means the condition \"if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition\" is false, and thus the entire statement is true because a false antecedent makes the conditional statement true.\n\nGiven Hannah works in student jobs on campus, according to premise 3, she either orders takeout frequently or enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes. Since she works in student jobs on campus, she must order takeout frequently (premise 2). Therefore, she is not an enjoyer of dining hall meals and recipes.\n\nSince Hannah does not enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, according to premise 4, she is a picky eater. According to premise 5, if she enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. Since she does not enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, this premise does not apply to her.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\" is true because Hannah is a picky eater and the \"if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\" part is irrelevant.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>A</answer>",

Given that being terricolous implies having legs, and having legs implies jumping, we can infer that if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, it must be terricolous, which would imply it has legs and thus jumps.
