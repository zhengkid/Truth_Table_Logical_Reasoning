People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\n2. If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\n3. If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.\n4. If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\n5. If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home.\n6. Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n\nFrom premises 1 and 2, we know that if someone is born in a multiple birth with siblings, they spend a lot of time with those siblings. Premise 3 tells us that if someone complains about annoying siblings, they must have siblings who were born together. Premise 4 and 5 together imply that if someone spends a lot of time with their siblings, they often live at home. Premise 6 gives us a disjunction about Luke's situation.\n\nLet's consider the two cases for Luke:\n\nCase 1: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers.\n- If Luke is born in a multiple birth, he spends a lot of time with his siblings (from premise 1).\n- However, if he lives with strangers, he does not live at home (from premise 4), and thus does not spend a lot of time with his siblings (from premise 5). This creates a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n- If Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth, he does not spend a lot of time with his siblings (from premise 1).\n- If he does not live with strangers, he lives at home (from premise 4), and thus spends a lot of time with his siblings (from premise 5). This also creates a contradiction.\n\nSince both cases lead to contradictions, the only consistent scenario is that Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. This means he does not spend a lot of time with his siblings and does not live at home. \n\nPremise 3 states that if people complain about annoying siblings, they have siblings who were born together. Since Luke does not have siblings who were born together, he does not complain about annoying siblings.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings\" is false.\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\n(B) False\n</answer>",

        "rationale": "Let's break down the premises and see if we can deduce the truth of the statement about Peter.\n\n1. If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.\n2. All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\n3. If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\n4. If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\n5. All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.\n6. Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.\n\nFrom premise 3 and 4, we can infer that if someone is cleanly, they must value order and spotlessness, and if they value order and spotlessness, they are cleanly. Therefore, being cleanly and valuing order and spotlessness are equivalent.\n\nFrom premise 2, if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, they spill a lot of food on their clothing and are not notably tidy.\n\nFrom premise 5, if someone's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, they themselves value order and spotlessness, and thus are cleanly.\n\nNow, let's analyze Peter's condition from premise 6. Peter is either:\n- A person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or\n- A person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.\n\nIf Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, then he is not notably tidy (from premise 1) and is cleanly (from premise 3). This means he must value order and spotlessness (from premise 4). If his family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter values order and spotlessness, and thus is cleanly.\n\nIf Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly, then he is notably tidy (from premise 1). Since he is not cleanly, he does not value order and spotlessness, and thus his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement: \"Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.\"\n\nIf Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, he spills a lot of food on his clothing and is not notably tidy. This means he must value order and spotlessness, and thus his family prioritizes order and spotlessness. This part of the statement is true if Peter is a clumsy foodie and his family prioritizes order and spotlessness.\n\nIf Peter is not a clumsy foodie and his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness, then he does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. This means he is notably tidy, and his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness. This part of the statement is also true if Peter is not a clumsy foodie and his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true for both conditions.\n\nThe statement is true.\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\n(A) True\n</answer>",

From Premise 2, we know that some objects of worship are fir trees. Therefore, some objects of worship are evergreens. However, this does not necessarily mean that all evergreens are objects of worship. There could be evergreens that are not objects of worship.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider a hypothetical scenario:\n- Let's say there are 10 evergreen trees in total.\n- Out of these 10 evergreen trees, 3 are fir trees and are also objects of worship.\n- The remaining 7 evergreen trees are not fir trees and are not objects of worship.\n\nIn this scenario, we can see that some evergreens (the 7 non-fir trees) are not objects of worship.

However, Premise 2 states that people who make wedding plans invite others to their ceremony. Therefore, if John is engaged, he cannot make wedding plans, which means he cannot invite others to his ceremony. This creates a contradiction because Premise 6 states that if John has a larger family, he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony. If John is engaged, he cannot invite friends, so he cannot have a well-attended wedding either. This means John cannot have a larger family if he is engaged.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that John is not engaged. If John is not engaged, then he could potentially have a larger family. However, Premise 4 states that some people who have well-attended weddings have larger families. This means it is possible for John to have a larger family without being engaged, but we do not have enough information to conclude that he does have a larger family.\n\nGiven the premises, the only consistent scenario is that if John is engaged, he does not have a larger family. Since we do not have any information that contradicts the possibility of John not being engaged, we can conclude that John does not have a larger family if he is engaged, which is the most consistent interpretation of the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"John does not have a larger family\" is true based on the given premises.\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\n(A) True\n</answer>",

However, we are also given that platypuses have no teeth (premise 2). This is a contradiction if we assume platypuses are mammals with no teeth.\n- The statement that humans have teeth (premise 4) is unrelated to the classification of platypuses as mammals or reptiles.\n\nThe key contradiction is that if platypuses are mammals, they should have teeth according to premise 1, but premise 2 states they have no teeth. This contradiction suggests that the classification of platypuses as mammals might be incorrect based on the given premises.\n\nHowever, the conclusion we are evaluating is whether platypuses are reptiles.

Therefore, if KiKi is terricolous, KiKi must have legs and thus jump.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditional statement in Premise 7:\n- If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n- This means if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, it must be either terricolous or have legs. Since having legs implies jumping, this statement is contradictory if KiKi does not have legs. Therefore, KiKi must have legs or be terricolous.\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can conclude that KiKi must either have legs (and thus jump) or be terricolous (and thus have legs). This means KiKi cannot be a dog (since all dogs bark and bark is not liked by Jane), and KiKi must bark if it is a dog.\n\nTherefore, KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog cannot be true based on the premises provided.\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\n(B) False\n</answer>",
