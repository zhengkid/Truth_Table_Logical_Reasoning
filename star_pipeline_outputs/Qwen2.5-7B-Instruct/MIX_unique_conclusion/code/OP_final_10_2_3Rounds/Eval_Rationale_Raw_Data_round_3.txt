From premise 1, if a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, it has not received many negative reviews. Therefore, if the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, it has not received many negative reviews.\n\nPremise 5 states that the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. If it has a rating greater than four, then it has not received many negative reviews (from premises 2 and 1). If it is popular among local residents, it has a rating greater than four (from premise 4), and thus it has not received many negative reviews.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four or is popular among local residents, it does not receive many negative reviews.\n\nSince the Hamden Plaza Subway store does not receive many negative reviews, the statement \"The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews\" is true, because it does not receive many negative reviews.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\n(A) True\n</answer>",

Therefore, if a restaurant has a rating greater than four, it has not received many negative reviews.\n\nPremise 3 states that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.

This means that if a restaurant is popular among local residents, it must have a rating greater than four.\n\nPremise 5 states that the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. This means that the Hamden Plaza Subway store either has a rating greater than four or it is popular among local residents (or both).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n- If the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, then it has not received many negative reviews (from premises 2 and 1).\n- If the Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents, then it has a rating greater than four (from premise 4), and thus it has not received many negative reviews (from premises 2 and 1).\n\nIn both scenarios, the Hamden Plaza Subway store has not received many negative reviews.

This means Tom could potentially move in with Fluffy.\n- However, we need to check if the security deposit condition is met. The security deposit can be either equal to or more than the monthly rent. Since the monthly rent is $2000, the security deposit must be $2000 or more. This is more than $1500, so the condition for Tom to move in is not met.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, Tom is not allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy because the security deposit condition is not satisfied.</nl_cot>\n<answer>\n(B) False\n</answer>",

If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\n3. If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.\n4. If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\n5. If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home.\n\nFrom the given statement:\nLuke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n\nLet's consider the two cases:\nCase 1: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers.\n- From premise 1, people born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings. However, this does not necessarily mean Luke does because he lives with strangers.\n- From premise 4, if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, he often lives at home. But he lives with strangers, so he does not live at home.\n- From premise 5, if Luke lives at home, he does not live with strangers. But he does live with strangers, so he does not live at home.\n- This creates a contradiction, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n- If Luke is not born in a multiple birth, he does not have siblings born in a multiple birth.\n- If he does not live with strangers, he must live at home (from premise 4).\n- From premise 5, if he lives at home, he does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n- This means Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\nSince both cases lead to the conclusion that Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, the statement is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\n(B) False\n</answer>",

If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\n5. If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home.\n\nFrom premise 5, we can infer that if people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. From premise 1, we know that people who are born in a multiple birth spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings. Therefore, people who are born in a multiple birth often live at home.\n\nPremise 6 states that Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. This means Luke cannot both be born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, and he cannot both not be born in a multiple birth and live at home.\n\nLet's consider the two cases for Luke:\n\nCase 1: Luke is born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers.\n- From premise 4, if Luke lives with strangers, he does not live at home.\n- From premise 5, if Luke is born in a multiple birth, he often lives at home.\n- Therefore, this case is impossible because Luke cannot both live with strangers and live at home.\n\nCase 2: Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n- From premise 4, if Luke does not live with strangers, he lives at home.\n- From premise 5, if Luke is not born in a multiple birth, he does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n- From premise 1, if Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, he does not often live at home.\n- Therefore, this case is also impossible because Luke cannot both live at home and not live at home.\n\nSince both cases are impossible, we need to consider the logical structure of the problem. The only remaining possibility is that Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers, which means he lives at home and does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings. This means he does not complain often about annoying siblings.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings\" is true.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\n(A) True\n</answer>",

Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.\n4. Peter's birds can fly.\n5. All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.\n6. If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.\n7. Rock is Peter's pet.\n8. Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that Rock is either a monkey or a bird. Let's consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: Rock is a monkey.\n- Since all monkeys are mammals (premise 2), and all mammals that are Peter's pets are animals (premise 1), Rock is an animal.\n- Rock can fly (premise 7), and if a pet can fly, it has wings (premise 6), so Rock has wings.\n- Since Rock is a monkey, it fits all the premises and conclusions so far.\n\nCase 2: Rock is a bird.\n- Since all birds can fly (premise 4), Rock can fly.\n- Since all animals that are Peter's pets can breathe (premise 5), Rock can breathe.\n- Rock cannot be both a monkey and a bird, so if Rock is a bird, it cannot be a monkey.\n\nNow, let's consider the last premise: Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.\n- If Rock can fly, it must have wings (premise 6).\n- If Rock is a bird, it can fly (premise 4).\n- If Rock cannot breathe, it cannot be a pet of Peter (premise 5).\n\nSince Rock is Peter's pet, it cannot be the case that Rock cannot breathe. Therefore, we are left with two possibilities:\n- Rock can fly, and it has wings.\n- Rock is a bird.\n\nIn either case, Rock cannot be a monkey. Therefore, the statement \"Rock is a monkey\" is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\n(B) False\n</answer>",
