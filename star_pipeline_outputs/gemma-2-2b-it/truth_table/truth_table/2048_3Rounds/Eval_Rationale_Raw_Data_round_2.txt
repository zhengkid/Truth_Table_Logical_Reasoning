Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. \nEveryone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. \nEmployees have lunch either in the company building or at home.\nIf an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.\nAll employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. \nNo managers work remotely from home. \nJames will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJames has lunch in the company.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nWhen the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox. \nMonkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.\nHumans are mammals.\nMammals are animals.\nSymptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. \nPeople feel tired when they get the flu.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nNo one gets the flu.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? No one gets the flu.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. \nSome turtles can be spotted near the campus. \nThe only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.\nIf something is skittish, then it is not calm.\nAll the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.\nRockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nRockie is a turtle.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. \nSome turtles can be spotted near the campus. \nThe only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.\nIf something is skittish, then it is not calm.\nAll the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.\nRockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. \nSome turtles can be spotted near the campus. \nThe only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.\nIf something is skittish, then it is not calm.\nAll the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.\nRockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll aliens are extraterrestrials.\nIf someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.\nNo extraterrestrials are human.\nAll highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.\nMarvin is a highly intelligent being.\nMarvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.\nIf Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nMarvin is an alien.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nEveryone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\nEvery Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.\nAll Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.\nAll professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.\nIf a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.\nIf a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous.\nAll well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.\nDjokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nDjokovic does not live in a tax haven.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Djokovic does not live in a tax haven.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. \nEveryone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.\nAll female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\nAll tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.\nAll male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.\nIf Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\nCoco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nCoco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nThere are four seasons in a year: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter.\nAll students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.\nEmma's favorite season is summer.\nMia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's. \nJames wants to have a long vacation.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJames's favorite season is summer.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNo digital media are analog.\nEvery printed text is analog media.\nAll streaming services are digital media.\nIf an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.\nIf 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n1984 is a streaming service.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? 1984 is a streaming service.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNo digital media are analog.\nEvery printed text is analog media.\nAll streaming services are digital media.\nIf an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.\nIf 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n1984 is not a streaming service.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? 1984 is not a streaming service.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll Romance languages are Indo-European languages.\nRomance languages are a language family.\nAll languages within a language family are related to each other.\nFrench and Spanish are both Romance languages.\nGerman is related to Spanish.\nBasque is not related to any other language.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nBasque is a Romance language.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll Romance languages are Indo-European languages.\nRomance languages are a language family.\nAll languages within a language family are related to each other.\nFrench and Spanish are both Romance languages.\nGerman is related to Spanish.\nBasque is not related to any other language.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nGerman is a Romance language.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBillings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.\nThe state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.\nWhite Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.\nThe city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.\nAny city in Butte is not in St Pierre.\nA city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nButte and St Pierre are in the same state.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBillings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.\nThe state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.\nWhite Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.\nThe city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.\nAny city in Butte is not in St Pierre.\nA city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nSt Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBillings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.\nThe state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.\nWhite Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.\nThe city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.\nAny city in Butte is not in St Pierre.\nA city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nMontana is home to the city of Missoula.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Montana is home to the city of Missoula.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNo baked sweets are spicy.\nAll cupcakes are baked sweets.\nAll mala hotpots are spicy.\nAll products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.\nDried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nDried Thai chilies are not products of Baked by Melissa.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNo baked sweets are spicy.\nAll cupcakes are baked sweets.\nAll mala hotpots are spicy.\nAll products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.\nDried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nDried Thai chilies are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\nSome restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.\nThe Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\nSome restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.\nThe Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\nSome restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.\nThe Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? The Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nA natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.\nIf the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.\nMachine translation is a natural language processing task.\nThe output of machine translation is a text sequence.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nMachine translation is a language understanding task.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Machine translation is a language understanding task.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPets are allowed in some managed buildings.\nA deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.\nThe security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.\nFluffy is Tom's cat.\nCats are pets.\nThe Olive Garden is a managed building.\nThe monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.\n$2000 is more than $1500.\nTom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\nIf a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPets are allowed in some managed buildings.\nA deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.\nThe security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.\nFluffy is Tom's cat.\nCats are pets.\nThe Olive Garden is a managed building.\nThe monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.\n$2000 is more than $1500.\nTom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\nIf a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll business organizations are legal entities.\nAll companies are business organizations.\nAll private companies are companies.\nAll legal entities are created under law. \nAll legal entities have legal obligations.\nIf the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations and is a private company.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll business organizations are legal entities.\nAll companies are business organizations.\nAll private companies are companies.\nAll legal entities are created under law. \nAll legal entities have legal obligations.\nIf the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf the Harvard Weekly Book club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAnimals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.\nAll animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. \nAll vertebrate animals have a backbone.\nAll bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.\nAll queen bees are bees.\nHarry is a bee.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nHarry is a queen bee.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPeople who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\nIf people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\nIf people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.\nIf people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\nIf people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. \nLuke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nLuke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIt costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\nETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.\nThose living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.\nTom lives in a single-parent family.\nTom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. \nTom is applying to take the GRE test.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nETS provides financial aid to Tom.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.\nAll clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\nIf people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\nIf people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\nAll people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.\nPeter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nPeter is notably tidy.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.\nAll clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\nIf people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\nIf people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\nAll people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.\nPeter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nPeter is either a  clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or he is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Peter is either a  clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or he is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nThe Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas.\nJuan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.\nThe Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.\nThere are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nAll Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.\nAll single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\nAll Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. \nIf John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJohn's car is not a Solo EV.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.\nAll monkeys are mammals. \nPeter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. \nPeter's birds can fly.\nAll animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.\nIf Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.\nRock is Peter's pet.\nRock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nRock is a monkey.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.\nIf a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.\nIf a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.\nAll family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.\nAll movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is a film.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is rated General Audience.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is rated General Audience.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNew Vessel Press is a publishing house specializing in translating foreign literature into English.\nAll of New Vessel Press's published books are in English.\nNeapolitan Chronicles is a book published by New Vessel Press.\nNeapolitan Chronicles was translated from Italian.\nPalace of Flies is a book published by New Vessel Press.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nNeapolitan Chronicles is an English book.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.\nIf a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.\nThe Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.\nAll shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.\nBreaking Bad is a show.\nBreaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nHeinrich Schmidt was a German politician. \nHeinrich Schmidt was also a member of the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nNo politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? No politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. \nSevere cancers are deadly diseases.\nBile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. \nAll Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\nMild flu comes with a low survival rate.\nColorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nColorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nAll people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\nAll people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\nAll people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nIf people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\nTaylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTaylor eats salads regularly.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nAll people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\nAll people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\nAll people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nIf people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\nTaylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTaylor visits the gym at least once a day.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNo one nice to animals is also mean to animals.\nSome grumpy people are mean to animals.\nAll animal lovers are nice to animals.\nAll pet owners love animals.\nTom is a pet owner.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome professional basketball players are not American nationals.\nAll professional basketball players can do jump shots.\nIf someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.\nIf someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. \nYuri does not activate his leg muscles.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nYuri is not an American professional basketball player.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome professional basketball players are not American nationals.\nAll professional basketball players can do jump shots.\nIf someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.\nIf someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. \nYuri does not activate his leg muscles.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nYuri is an American professional basketball player.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nJane does not like any animals that bark.\nAll dogs are animals that bark.\nJane likes all animals that jump.\nIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\nIf an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. \nKiKi is an animal.\nIf KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nKiKi is a barking dog.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nJane does not like any animals that bark.\nAll dogs are animals that bark.\nJane likes all animals that jump.\nIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\nIf an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. \nKiKi is an animal.\nIf KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nKiKi does not bark and he is not a dog.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>.
