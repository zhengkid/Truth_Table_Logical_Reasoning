It iterates through the premises and updates the entities based on the rules.\n3. **Final Result:** The function checks if the conclusion is true or false based on the updated entities and returns \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\" accordingly.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The code uses a basic inference approach based on the provided premises and conclusion.\n* It's essential to understand that this is a simplified example and real-world inference might require more complex rules and reasoning. \n* This code is provided as a starting point and can be further expanded and improved based on your specific requirements.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore different inference rules or have any further questions!",

The `Breeding` class inherits from `Animal` and has a new attribute `is_artificially_selected`.\n2. **Inference Function:** The `infer` function takes the premises and conclusion as input. It then iterates through the premises, checking for the presence of \"animals\". It then iterates through the animals in the premises and checks if the animal is of the `Breeding` class. If it is, it sets the `is_artificially_selected` attribute to either \"True\" or \"False\" based on the premise. Finally, it updates the conclusion based on the premises.\n3. **Main Function:** The `main` function defines the premises and conclusion, calls the `infer` function, and prints the result. \n\nThis code represents a basic framework for inference.  You can modify and expand it to incorporate more complex inference rules and handle various types of entities and properties.",
