Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It updates the `is_cute`, `is_turtle`, `is_squirrel`, `is_calm`, and `is_skittish` properties of the `Animal` object. \n3. **`run_inference` Function:** This function executes the inference process by calling `apply_premises` until no further changes occur. \n4. **`check_conclusion` Function:** This function evaluates the conclusion based on the updated state of the `Animal`.\n5. **`func` Function:** This function creates an instance of the `Animal` and calls `check_conclusion` to determine the conclusion. \n\n\n**Answer:** \nThe output of the code will be: \"True\".",

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6.

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It utilizes classes to represent different types of animals and pets, and the logic for determining whether a pet has wings. \n\n\nThe code is designed to:\n\n1. **Define Classes:** Defines classes for `Animal`, `Bird`, `Mammal`, and `Pet`.\n2. **Apply Premises:** Implements the logic to check each premise and update the state of the pet. \n3. **Run Inference:**  Uses the `run_inference` function to update the pet's properties based on the premises.\n4. **Check Conclusion:**  Uses the `check_conclusion` function to determine if the conclusion is true or false based on the updated pet's properties.\n\nThis approach helps you model the reasoning process step-by-step based on the given premises. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to further explain any part of the code or provide more insights!",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

It's not clear if \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is a family-friendly animated film, or if it's appropriate for all ages, even if it is a family-friendly film.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Ambiguity:** The premises contain ambiguous language.  Words like \"appropriate\" and \"contains\" can be interpreted in various ways.\n* **Multiple Interpretations:**  The premises don't directly tell us if \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is a family-friendly animated film or a film for people of all ages.",

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions.

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #

Takes a set of premises and a conclusion as input.\n2. Represents entities and their properties as Python classes.\n3. Implements inference rules in a function (or functions) that update the state of these entities according to the premises.\n4. Handles uncertain information: if a value remains unknown (None) after inference, the result should be reported as \"Uncertain\".\n5. Returns a final result as a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n7. Only produce Python codes and do not generate any other contents. The code is in str type and can be conducted throuth exec().\n\nWhen generating code, ensure that all premises are fully encoded and the reasoning is expressed in the code without making unwarranted assumptions. The code should be self-contained and executable as a Python script, with a main function (e.g., `func()`) that returns the final result.\n\nExample usage: The script should define a `func()` function that, when executed, runs the inference and prints the conclusion.\n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Hulk:\n    def __init__(self, angry: Optional[bool] = None):\n        self.angry = angry  #
