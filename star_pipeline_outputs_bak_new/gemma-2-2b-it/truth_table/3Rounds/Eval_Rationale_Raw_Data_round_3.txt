Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

WinterOlympics(Beijing)\nChecking the Truth Table:\n\t1. For all validated rows where SummerOlympics(Beijing) = Yes and WinterOlympics(Beijing) = Yes, we observe that Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2008 Winter Olympics.\n\t2. For rows where SummerOlympics(Beijing) = No or WinterOlympics(Beijing) = No, the implication holds true because the premise is false, making the statement valid by definition.\nTherefore, the Answer is (A).\n</Solution>\nThe final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>",

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSymphony No. 9 is a music piece.\nComposers write music pieces.\nBeethoven wrote Symphony No. 9.\nVienna Music Society premiered Symphony No. 9.\nVienna Music Society is an orchestra.\nBeethoven leads the Vienna Music Society.\nOrchestras are led by conductors.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nSome orchestras premiered music pieces.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll Romance languages are Indo-European languages.\nRomance languages are a language family.\nAll languages within a language family are related to each other.\nFrench and Spanish are both Romance languages.\nGerman is related to Spanish.\nBasque is not related to any other language.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nBasque is a Romance language.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBillings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.\nThe state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.\nWhite Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.\nThe city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.\nAny city in Butte is not in St Pierre.\nA city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nButte and St Pierre are in the same state.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIt costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\nETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.\nThose living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.\nTom lives in a single-parent family.\nTom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. \nTom is applying to take the GRE test.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nNo one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.\nAll clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\nIf people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\nIf people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\nAll people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.\nPeter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nPeter is notably tidy.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\nMichael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.\nIf person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z\nPeter is a man who is taller than Michael.\nMichael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\nMichael cannot block Windy's shooting.\nEvery shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nPeter can block Windy's shooting.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Peter can block Windy's shooting.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.\nAll monkeys are mammals. \nPeter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. \nPeter's birds can fly.\nAll animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.\nIf Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.\nRock is Peter's pet.\nRock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nRock has wings.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome professional basketball players are not American nationals.\nAll professional basketball players can do jump shots.\nIf someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.\nIf someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. \nYuri does not activate his leg muscles.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nYuri is not an American professional basketball player.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.
