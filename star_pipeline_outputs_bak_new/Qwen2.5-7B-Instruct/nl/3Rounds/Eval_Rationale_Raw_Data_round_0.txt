        "rationale": "Step 1: Analyze the premises related to Bonnie's status in the club. The premise states \"Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\" This can be simplified to two scenarios:\n   - Scenario 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school.\n   - Scenario 2: Bonnie is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nStep 2: Consider the implications of Scenario 1. If Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, we need to check if she performs in school talent shows often. The premises state that \"People in this club who perform in school talent shows often are very engaged with school events.\" Therefore, if Bonnie is very engaged with school events, it follows that she performs in school talent shows often.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of Scenario 2. If Bonnie is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school, we need to check if she performs in school talent shows often. The premises state that \"People in this club who perform in school talent shows often are very engaged with school events.\" Since Bonnie is not very engaged with school events in this scenario, she cannot perform in school talent shows often.\n\nStep 4: Determine Bonnie's status based on the given information. We do not have enough information to definitively conclude which scenario applies to Bonnie. We only know that Bonnie is in the club and fits one of the two scenarios. Without additional information about Bonnie's level of engagement or her student status, we cannot determine if she performs in school talent shows often.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, the statement \"Bonnie performs in school talent shows often\" is uncertain.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

James cannot be in both a situation where he has lunch at home or works remotely from home and be a manager or in other countries.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true based on the given premises.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. \nSome turtles can be spotted near the campus. \nThe only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.\nIf something is skittish, then it is not calm.\nAll the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.\nRockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

Since we know she will binge-watch \"Stranger Things,\" it does not provide information about whether she will download \"Stranger Things\" or any other show.\n\nStep 3: The premise \"Karen does not download 'Black Mirror'\" directly states that Karen does not download \"Black Mirror.\" Since Karen does not download \"Black Mirror,\" it means she does not binge-watch \"Black Mirror\" either, as downloading a show is contingent on binge-watching it.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa\" is conditional. Since we have established that Karen does not binge-watch \"Black Mirror,\" we cannot use this premise to conclude that she will share \"Black Mirror\" with Lisa.\n\nStep 5: Given that Karen does not download \"Black Mirror,\" and since downloading is a prerequisite for sharing (as per the conditional statement), we can infer that Karen will not share \"Black Mirror\" with Lisa.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Karen will share 'Black Mirror' with Lisa\" is false based on the given premises.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Since the latter case is not possible based on the given premises, the only conclusion is that a design by Max that he adores is evocative and dreamy.\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

However, this does not specify whether all Brown Swiss cattle are pets or not. It only states that there is an overlap between Brown Swiss cattle and pets.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"Alligators are not domesticated animals\" and the fact that \"Ted is an alligator\" confirm that Ted, as an alligator, is not a domesticated animal.\n\nStep 5: The conclusion states \"If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet.\" For this to be true, Ted would need to be a domesticated animal (since all Brown Swiss cattle are cows and all cows are domesticated animals) but not a pet. However, we do not have enough information to definitively state that no Brown Swiss cattle are pets. The premise only indicates that some Brown Swiss cattle are pets, not that none are.\n\nStep 6: Given that we cannot conclusively determine from the premises that no Brown Swiss cattle are pets, the statement \"If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet\" remains uncertain.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nYale University is a private Ivy League research university.\nYale University moved to New Haven in 1716.\nYale university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.\nA list of residential colleges at Yale: Benjamin Franklin College, Berkeley College, Branford College, Davenport College, Ezra Stiles College, Grace Hopper College, Jonathan Edwards College, Morse College, Pauli Murray College, Pierson College, Saybrook College, Silliman College, Timothy Dwight College, and Trumbull College.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nYale University has the largest university endowment of any educational institution.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

        "conclusions": "Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.",
        "rationale": "Step 1: Analyze the premise \"Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\" This can be broken down into two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n   - Scenario 1: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers.\n   - Scenario 2: Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n\nStep 2: Consider Scenario 1. If Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, then from the premise \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings,\" we can infer that people born in a multiple birth spend a lot of time with their siblings. However, from the premise \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home,\" and the fact that Luke lives with strangers, we know that Luke does not often live at home. This creates a contradiction because if Luke were to spend a lot of time hanging out with his siblings, he would have to live at home according to the premise. Therefore, Scenario 1 is not possible.\n\nStep 3: Consider Scenario 2. If Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers, then we cannot use the premise \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings\" to conclude anything about Luke's behavior. Additionally, since he does not live with strangers, we cannot use the premise \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home\" to infer that Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with his siblings. Thus, Scenario 2 does not provide enough information to conclude that Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with his siblings.\n\nStep 4: Since both scenarios lead to either contradictions or lack of sufficient information, we cannot definitively conclude that Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings based solely on the given premises.\nTherefore, the statement is uncertain.\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

And if he is not born in a multiple birth, he would not spend time with his siblings, nor would he complain about them.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings\" is true based on the given premises.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

This means if Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, he cannot be cleanly, and if he is cleanly, he cannot spill a lot of food on his clothing.\n\nStep 7: Combining steps 2 and 6, we can infer that if Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, then he cannot be cleanly.

        "rationale": "Step 1: Analyze the premise \"If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.\" This premise directly links John's engagement status to his actions regarding wedding plans and inviting friends. It tells us that if John is engaged, he does not make wedding plans, and therefore does not invite friends.\n\nStep 2: Consider the premise \"All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.\" This tells us that making wedding plans is a subset of being engaged. If someone is making wedding plans, they must be engaged.\n\nStep 3: From Step 1 and Step 2, we can infer that if John makes wedding plans, he is engaged, and if he invites friends, he is not making wedding plans. This creates a contradiction if John is making wedding plans and invites friends, as it would mean he is both engaged and not engaged.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans\" tells us that inviting others is a subset of making wedding plans. Therefore, if John invites friends, he is making wedding plans, and by Step 2, he must be engaged.\n\nStep 5: The premise \"If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony\" suggests a conditional relationship. If John has a larger family, he must either have a well-attended wedding or invite friends. However, this does not directly confirm or deny whether John has a larger family.\n\nStep 6: The premise \"Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families\" indicates a possibility but does not provide a definitive link between well-attended weddings and larger families for John.\n\nStep 7: Since John is engaged (from the contradiction in Step 1 and Step 2), he cannot be making wedding plans and inviting friends.

If John has a larger family, he must either have a well-attended wedding or invite friends to his ceremony. However, from Step 4, we know that if John is engaged, he cannot invite friends to his ceremony.

Therefore, it does not provide a direct link to John being engaged.\n\nStep 5: Consider the premise \"If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.\" This premise seems to contradict the idea of John making wedding plans, but it is conditional on John being engaged. It does not provide a direct statement about John's current status.\n\nStep 6: Examine the premise \"If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.\" This premise does not directly state that John has a larger family, but it suggests a scenario where John could have a well-attended wedding or invite friends to his ceremony. If John had a well-attended wedding, according to Step 3, he would be engaged. If he invited friends to his ceremony, then he would not be making wedding plans (and thus, not engaged, according to Step 1).\n\nStep 7: Since none of the premises directly state that John is engaged or not engaged, and the conditional statements do not provide a definitive answer about John's current status, we cannot conclude with certainty whether John is engaged or not based solely on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"John is engaged\" is uncertain.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.\nIf a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.\nIf a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.\nAll family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.\nAll movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is a film.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series or both.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series or both.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Therefore, if Ekaterina is a Russian Federation official, she must have U.S. citizenship.\n\nStep 5: The premise \"Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom\" tells us that Vladimir does not have Taiwanese citizenship and does not work for Gazprom. However, it does not provide any information about his U.S. citizenship status.\n\nStep 6: The premise \"Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official\" means that if Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, she does not need to be a Russian Federation official, or vice versa. \n\nStep 7: If Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, from Step 1, she can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\n\nStep 8: If Ekaterina is a Russian Federation official, from Step 4, she must have U.S. citizenship, and from Step 1, she can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\n\nStep 9: From the information provided, we do not have any direct information about Vladimir's U.S. citizenship status, only that he does not have Taiwanese citizenship and does not work for Gazprom. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether he can register to vote in the United States based on the given premises.\n\nStep 10: Given the information, if Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, she can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election. If she is a Russian Federation official, she also has U.S. citizenship and can participate in the election. Therefore, it is possible that both Ekaterina and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\n\nStep 11: Since we cannot definitively determine Vladimir's U.S. citizenship status and the possibility exists that both Ekaterina and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election, the statement \"It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election\" is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

        "rationale": "Step 1: Analyze the premises provided. The first premise states that if George likes music, he wants to compose. The second premise states that if George has access to a program, he can compose. The third premise states that if George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.\n\nStep 2: Consider the conclusion: \"If George will not compose, George can not compose.\" To validate this, we need to see if the premises logically lead to this conclusion.\n\nStep 3: From the third premise, \"If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose,\" we can infer that for George to compose, two conditions must be met: he must be able to compose and he must want to compose.\n\nStep 4: The second premise, \"If George has access to a program, he can compose,\" tells us that having access to a program is a condition for George to be able to compose. However, this does not provide information about his desire to compose.\n\nStep 5: The first premise, \"If George likes music, he wants to compose,\" suggests that liking music is a condition for George to want to compose. Again, this does not directly relate to his ability to compose, but rather his desire.\n\nStep 6: Now, let's consider the scenario where George will not compose. For George not to compose, at least one of the two necessary conditions (being able to compose and wanting to compose) must not be met. If George can compose but does not want to, he will not compose. If George does not have access to a program, he cannot compose. If George does not like music, he does not want to compose.\n\nStep 7: However, the conclusion \"If George will not compose, George can not compose\" suggests that the inability to compose is the only reason for not composing. This is not necessarily true based on the premises. George can also choose not to compose even if he can and wants to, for example, if he decides that he does not want to compose at that moment.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because there could be other reasons for George not composing, such as a lack of desire or a conscious decision, beyond just the inability to compose.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).</Answer>",

This means that the show mentioned in Step 1, which gives out roses on TV, is an episode of The Bachelor.\n\nStep 3: From the premise \"The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people,\" we know that the show that gives out roses on TV (which is an episode of The Bachelor) portrays the lives of real people.\n\nStep 4: From the premise \"All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows,\" we can infer that the episode of The Bachelor which gives out roses on TV is a reality TV show.\n\nStep 5: The premise \"Breaking Bad is a show\" is given, but does not provide any direct information about it giving out roses or its schedule.\n\nStep 6: The premise \"Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show\" directly states that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. Since the show that gives out roses on TV is a reality TV show (from Step 4), it cannot be Breaking Bad.\n\nStep 7: Given that the show giving out roses on TV is an episode of The Bachelor (from Step 2) and not Breaking Bad (from Step 6), it is impossible for roses to be given out during Breaking Bad. Therefore, the statement \"If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm\" is based on an impossible scenario.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false because the antecedent (roses are given out during Breaking Bad) is impossible given the premises.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

This is a contradiction because if it were a bile duct cancer, it would have to have a low survival rate, but it does not.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion based on the premises.\n- The statement claims that Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, which is false because Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of bile duct cancer, and Colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer.\n- The statement also claims that Colorectal cancer is a kind of mild flu, which is false because the premises do not suggest that Colorectal cancer is a mild flu; in fact, it is not a bile duct cancer and does not have a low survival rate, which is characteristic of a mild flu.\n- The statement also claims that Colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer, which is false based on the premises.\n\nStep 4: Since all parts of the conclusion are contradicted by the premises, the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then according to the premise \"All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly,\" Taylor eats salads regularly. Since she eats salads regularly, she is \"very conscious about her health and eating habits.\" But the premise \"All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits\" states that someone who disregards their physical well-being cannot be very conscious about their health and eating habits. Therefore, Scenario 1 is not possible because Taylor cannot both eat salads regularly (which means she is very conscious about her health and eating habits) and disregard her physical well-being.\n\nStep 3: Since Scenario 1 is not possible, Scenario 2 must be true.

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

        "rationale": "Step 1: From the premise \"No one nice to animals is also mean to animals,\" we can infer that being nice to animals excludes being mean to animals. In other words, if someone is nice to animals, they cannot be mean to animals, and vice versa.\n\nStep 2: From the premise \"Some grumpy people are mean to animals,\" we know that there exists at least one grumpy person who is mean to animals. However, this does not provide information about all grumpy people.\n\nStep 3: From the premise \"All animal lovers are nice to animals,\" we can infer that if someone is an animal lover, then they must be nice to animals. Since being nice to animals excludes being mean to animals, an animal lover cannot be mean to animals.\n\nStep 4: From the premise \"All pet owners love animals,\" we can infer that if someone is a pet owner, then they must be an animal lover. Since all animal lovers are nice to animals, and being nice to animals excludes being mean to animals, a pet owner cannot be mean to animals.\n\nStep 5: Since Tom is a pet owner, according to Step 4, Tom must be an animal lover and, therefore, nice to animals. Being nice to animals excludes being mean to animals, so Tom cannot be mean to animals.\n\nStep 6: From Step 5, we know that if Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom must be nice to animals (since being mean to animals excludes being nice to animals).\n\nStep 7: Since Tom is nice to animals (Step 5), and being nice to animals excludes being grumpy (Step 1), Tom cannot be a grumpy person. Therefore, if Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is not a grumpy person.\n\nStep 8: From Step 5, we also know that Tom is an animal lover (since he is a pet owner). Since being an animal lover excludes being grumpy (Step 1), Tom cannot be a grumpy person.

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome professional basketball players are not American nationals.\nAll professional basketball players can do jump shots.\nIf someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.\nIf someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. \nYuri does not activate his leg muscles.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

If KiKi jumps, it cannot bark (Step 1), and if KiKi has legs, it cannot bark (Step 4).\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, KiKi does not bark and is not a dog.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",
