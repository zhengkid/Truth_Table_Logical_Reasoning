If she is not very engaged and not a student, then she must be an inactive and disinterested member.\n\nStep 8: If Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member, then based on Step 4, she must chaperone high school dances. From Step 3, chaperones are not students of the school, so she cannot be a student.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, if Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member, she is not a student, and from Step 6, this means she cannot be very engaged and a student. Thus, the only possibility is that she is an inactive and disinterested member.\n\nStep 10: Since she is an inactive and disinterested member, she must chaperone high school dances (Step 4), and from Step 3, chaperones are not students of the school.

According to Premise 4, since she chaperones high school dances, she must be an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n- If Bonnie is neither a young child nor a teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then she does not fall under the category of young children and teenagers in the club who are students at the school.

If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, from Step 1, she is not a student who attends the school. From Step 3, this contradicts the condition that a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities must be a student who attends the school. Therefore, Bonnie cannot be a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities if she chaperones high school dances.\n\nStep 6: If Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances, then according to Step 4, she must perform in school talent shows often.

Since all of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries, and if a design with interesting geometries is a brutalist building and evocative, then any design by Zaha Hadid that Max adores must be both brutalist and evocative. However, from step 2, we know that no brutalist buildings that Max adores can have interesting geometries. This creates a contradiction because if a design by Zaha Hadid that Max adores is brutalist, it cannot have interesting geometries, but from step 1, it must have interesting geometries.\n\nStep 8: Since there is a contradiction, the only way to resolve it is if there are no designs by Zaha Hadid that Max adores, which means all designs Max adores must come from Kelly Wearstler.

If Coco Gauff is male, she lost to Rafael Nadal and is not a male player at Roland Garros 2022 (from step 5).\n\nStep 9: Since Coco Gauff cannot be both a female who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek and a male who lost to Rafael Nadal (as she is either one or the other), and since being ranked highly by the WTA implies being one of the most active players in major tennis, we can conclude that Coco Gauff cannot be both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

However, this premise does not provide any information about whether Mike specifically has an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\n\nStep 3: The premise \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" indicates that Mike is in a position to apply for CPT, which is only possible if he has an F1 visa according to the previous premise. This means that for Mike to be able to apply for CPT, he must have an F1 visa.

However, the premises do not explicitly state that Mike has an F1 visa; they only state the conditions under which he can apply for CPT.\n\nStep 5: Given that Mike is an international student who needs to apply for CPT to work in the US, and since only F1 visa holders can apply for CPT, the only way for Mike to satisfy the condition of needing to apply for CPT is to have an F1 visa. This means that Mike must have an F1 visa to meet the requirement for applying for CPT, but the premises do not explicitly state this.\n\nStep 6: Since the premises do not explicitly state that Mike has an F1 visa, and only imply that he must have one to apply for CPT, we cannot definitively conclude that Mike has an F1 visa based solely on the given information.

This means Tom could potentially be eligible for the financial aid provided by ETS.\n\nStep 7: Given that Tom meets the conditions for proving economic hardship and is applying to take the GRE test, it is possible that he could receive financial aid from ETS.\n\nStep 8: The conclusion states that \"No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something.\" However, based on the premises, we have established that Tom, who is applying to take the GRE test, could potentially receive financial aid if he proves economic hardship.\n\nStep 9: Since there is a possibility that at least one person (Tom) could receive financial aid, the statement \"No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something\" is not universally true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

If someone is cleanly, they must be notably tidy.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly\" indicates that valuing order and spotlessness is a sufficient condition for being cleanly.

We need to evaluate both scenarios to determine if Peter can be notably tidy.\n\nStep 7: Let's consider the first scenario where Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly. According to Step 1, if Peter spills a lot of food, he cannot be notably tidy. However, Step 3 states that being cleanly is a sufficient condition for being notably tidy. This creates a contradiction because if Peter is cleanly, he must be notably tidy, but Step 1 states he cannot be notably tidy if he spills a lot of food. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nStep 8: Now, let's consider the second scenario where Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. According to Step 1, if Peter does not spill a lot of food, he could potentially be notably tidy. However, Step 3 states that being cleanly is a sufficient condition for being notably tidy, and since Peter is not cleanly, he cannot be notably tidy based on this premise. Therefore, Peter cannot be notably tidy in this scenario either.\n\nStep 9: Since both scenarios presented for Peter lead to a contradiction or a condition that prevents Peter from being notably tidy, we can conclude that Peter cannot be notably tidy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

However, it is more useful for eliminating possibilities. If John is engaged, he does not invite friends to his ceremony. But this does not help us determine if John is engaged or not directly.\n\nStep 6: The premise \"If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony\" does not provide a definitive link to John's engagement status either.

Since we established in step 3 that if John invites others to his wedding, he is engaged, and from step 7, if John is engaged, he does not invite friends to his ceremony and does not make wedding plans, we can infer that if John has a larger family, he must have a well-attended wedding (since he does not invite friends).\nStep 9: Combining steps 4 and 8, if John has a larger family, then John has a well-attended wedding, and from step 4, if John has a well-attended wedding, he invites others to his wedding, which means John is engaged (from step 1).\nStep 10: From step 7, if John is engaged, he does not invite friends to his ceremony and does not make wedding plans.

        "rationale": "Step 1: The premise \"Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs\" indicates that Heck cattle were created with the intention of looking like aurochs. This implies that aurochs existed in the past and were used as a reference for breeding Heck cattle.\n\nStep 2: The premise \"Aurochs are animals\" confirms that aurochs belong to the category of animals, which means they were once living creatures.\n\nStep 3: The premise \"Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals\" suggests that there are instances where animals are bred to resemble species that are no longer alive. However, this premise does not provide information about whether aurochs are extinct or not.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"Heck cattle were bred back to resemble the aurochs\" combined with \"Aurochs are animals\" does not directly indicate the current status of aurochs. It only tells us that aurochs existed and were used as a model for breeding Heck cattle.\n\nStep 5: The conclusion \"Aurochs are extinct\" is not directly supported or refuted by the given premises. The premises do not provide any information about the current existence or extinction status of aurochs. \n\nStep 6: Given that the premises do not offer sufficient information to determine whether aurochs are currently extinct, the conclusion cannot be definitively proven true or false based solely on the provided premises.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Aurochs are extinct\" is uncertain based on the given premises.\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

If a person does not have United States citizenship, they must have Taiwanese citizenship.\n\nStep 4: From the premise \"No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship,\" we understand that Russian Federation officials must have either United States citizenship or some other citizenship not mentioned in the premises, but not Taiwanese citizenship.\n\nStep 5: From the premise \"Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom,\" we deduce that Vladimir does not have Taiwanese citizenship and, by extension, must have United States citizenship (since he cannot have Russian Federation citizenship as a Russian Federation official cannot have Taiwanese citizenship).\n\nStep 6: Since Vladimir has United States citizenship, from Step 2, we can conclude that Vladimir can register to vote in the United States and, from Step 1, he can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\n\nStep 7: From the premise \"Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official,\" we need to consider two cases:\n- If Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, then according to Step 1, she can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\n- If Ekaterina is a Russian federation official, then she cannot have Taiwanese citizenship (Step 4), and since she does not have United States citizenship (as she is a Russian federation official), she cannot register to vote in the United States.\n\nStep 8: Combining the information from Step 7, we see that if Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, she can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.

In fact, the premises suggest that if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, it would be a contradiction since Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show and thus not The Bachelor.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

However, since the premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark\" only applies to Jane's preferences and does not provide any direct information about the barking habits of all animals, we cannot conclude that KiKi barks or does not bark based solely on the information that he is an animal.\n\nStep 3: From the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump\" and the information that \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps,\" we can infer that if an animal has legs, then it jumps and Jane likes it.

This is because the only way for the statement \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs\" to be true is if KiKi is indeed terricolous (since he does not have legs and thus must be terricolous to satisfy the condition).\n\nStep 5: Since we know from step 4 that if KiKi does not have legs, he must be terricolous, and from the premise \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs,\" we can deduce that if KiKi is terricolous, he must have legs. This creates a contradiction because if KiKi does not have legs, he cannot be terricolous, and if he is terricolous, he must have legs. Therefore, KiKi must have legs, which means he must jump (from the premise \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps\").\n\nStep 6: Since we have established that KiKi must have legs and jump, and given the premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark,\" we cannot conclude that KiKi does not bark. The premise only states that Jane does not like barking animals, but it does not provide any direct information about KiKi's barking habits.\n\nStep 7: From the analysis, we can confirm that KiKi does not bark is uncertain because we have no direct information about KiKi's barking habits. We also know that KiKi is not a dog because all dogs bark, and we have established that KiKi does not bark, which means he cannot be a dog.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog\" is true based on the given premises.\n\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",
