This means, according to the premise \"If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy,\" that Peter is not notably tidy.\n\nStep 3:  The premise \"If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy\" tells us that if someone is clean, they are notably tidy.

Since Peter is not clean, he does not value order and spotlessness.\n\nStep 6:  Finally, the premise \"All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness\"  means that if a person's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then they themselves value it.
