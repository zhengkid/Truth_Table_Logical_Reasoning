The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nWhen the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox. \nMonkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.\nHumans are mammals.\nMammals are animals.\nSymptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. \nPeople feel tired when they get the flu.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nSymptoms of Monkeypox include coughing.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nThere are six types of wild turkeys: Eastern wild turkey, Osceola wild turkey, Gould\u2019s wild turkey, Merriam\u2019s wild turkey, Rio Grande wild turkey, and Ocellated wild turkey.\nTom is not an Eastern wild turkey.\nTom is not an Osceola wild turkey.\nTom is not a Gould's wild turkey.\nTom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey.\nTom is a wild turkey.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJoey is a wild turkey.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nA Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.\nAll games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.\nIf a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.\nThe Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. \nSome turtles can be spotted near the campus. \nThe only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.\nIf something is skittish, then it is not calm.\nAll the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.\nRockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\n\"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.\nIf a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.\nIf and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.\nKaren does not download \"Black Mirror.\"\n\"Black Mirror\" is a Netflix show.\nIf Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nKaren will share \"Black Mirror\" with Lisa.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nDiamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.\nRoderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.\nDiamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile.\nImperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nImperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSymphony No. 9 is a music piece.\nComposers write music pieces.\nBeethoven wrote Symphony No. 9.\nVienna Music Society premiered Symphony No. 9.\nVienna Music Society is an orchestra.\nBeethoven leads the Vienna Music Society.\nOrchestras are led by conductors.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nBeethoven is not a conductor.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll Romance languages are Indo-European languages.\nRomance languages are a language family.\nAll languages within a language family are related to each other.\nFrench and Spanish are both Romance languages.\nGerman is related to Spanish.\nBasque is not related to any other language.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nFrench is an Indo-European language.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBillings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.\nThe state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.\nWhite Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.\nThe city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.\nAny city in Butte is not in St Pierre.\nA city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nMontana is home to the city of Missoula.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBadults is a British Sitcom series starring members of Pappy's.\nBadults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three.\nThe Working title \"The Secret Dude Society\" was used for Badults.\nAndrew Collins was the script editor for Badults.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nAndrew Collins was the script editor for a series with the working title \"The Secret Dude Society\".\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.\nIf the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.\nSome stocks are growth stocks.\nAll mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.\nKO is a mature stock.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nKO is a stock and a growth stock.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34.\nPlates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul. \nJoe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. \nTom's license plate begins with the number 35. \nIf a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTom's license plate is from Istanbul.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPeople who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\nIf people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\nIf people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.\nIf people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\nIf people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. \nLuke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nLuke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.\nAll clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\nIf people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\nIf people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\nAll people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.\nPeter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nPeter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and issomeone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nThe Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas.\nJuan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.\nThe Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.\nThere are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJuan de Onate visited a mountain range in Texas.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPlungers suck.\nVacuums suck.\nVampires suck.\nSpace is a vacuum.\nA duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf something is a household appliance, it sucks.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll hydrocarbons are organic compounds .\nAll alkanes are hydrocarbons\nAll organic compounds are chemical compounds.\nAll organic compounds contain carbon.\nNo chemical compounds contain only one element.\nThe mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: given premises \"If Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\" and \"The Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up.\"\nStep 2: given premise \"If the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge.\"\nStep 3: given premise \"The Hulk is a destroyer.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge.\"\nStep 4: given premise \"Peter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian\"\nStep 5: given premise \"Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero.\"\nStep 6: given premise \"Peter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform\"\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 1>\n\n<EXAMPLE 2>\n<Premises>\nAll philosophers reason.\nSome sophists reason.\nAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood.\nNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is a sophist.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nHeinrich Schmidt was a German politician. \nHeinrich Schmidt was also a member of the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nHeinrich Schmidt was German or Russian or both.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll horses have hooves.\nNo humans have hooves.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nSome humans are horses.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.
