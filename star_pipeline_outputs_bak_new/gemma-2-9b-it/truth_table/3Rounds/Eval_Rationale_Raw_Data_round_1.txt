Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>.
