This introduces the concept of feistiness but doesn't connect it to jompuses.\n\n8. **Premise:** Each impus is spicy.  Again, unrelated to feistiness.\n\n9. **Premise:** Every impus is a rompus.

This connects Sam to the chain of jompuses, wumpuses, yumpuses, and ultimately, rompuses.\n\nSince every rompus is feisty, and Sam is a jompus which leads to the category of rompuses, we can conclude that Sam is feisty.\n\n\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>B</answer><end_of_answer>",
