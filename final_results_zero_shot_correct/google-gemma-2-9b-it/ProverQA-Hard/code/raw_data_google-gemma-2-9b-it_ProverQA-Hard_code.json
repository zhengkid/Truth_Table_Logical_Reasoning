Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nLexie develops skills.\nFor anyone who is creative and develops skills, they can achieve success.\nIf someone practices gratitude, then they will stay positive.\nFor all humans, if someone gets inspiration from nature, then they are either creative or produce unique art (or both).\nAll people with imagination are creative and appreciate beauty.\nLexie tells her story or expresses herself freely.\nLexie is not motivated.\nDavian practices gratitude.\nLexie builds a portfolio or gains recognition.\nLexie practices gratitude.\nAnyone who has good friends or focuses on their strengths can stay positive.\nIf Lexie has talent or gains recognition, then she will become iconic.\nLexie learns from failure.\nEveryone who either achieves success or faces challenges is motivated.\nLexie does not have talent.\nLexie does not become iconic.\nIf Lexie produces unique art or expresses herself freely, then she will gain recognition.\nGiovanni does not pursue her passion.\nIf Lexie faces challenges, then she either learns from failure or stays positive (but not both).\nIf Giovanni faces challenges, then she either learns from failure or stays positive (but not both).\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nLexie gets inspiration from nature.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
