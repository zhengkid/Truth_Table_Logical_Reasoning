Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nScarlette is an expert.\nScarlette either develops new skills or gains loyal clients, but not both.\nScarlette develops new skills.\nIf Scarlette either handles valuables or keeps confidences (but not both), then she is trusted.\nScarlette is reliable.\nAlaya is an expert.\nIf Scarlette is an expert, then she is either trusted or reliable, but not both.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nScarlette builds a good reputation.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Scarlette builds a good reputation.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<code>"
