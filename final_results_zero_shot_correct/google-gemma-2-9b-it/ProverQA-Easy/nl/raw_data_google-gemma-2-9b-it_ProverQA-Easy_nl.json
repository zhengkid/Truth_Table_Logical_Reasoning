Since Russell is knowledgeable about the environment, he fits this description.  \n\nWe are told that if someone supports endangered species or protects ecosystems (but not both), then they care about conservation.  We don't know if Russell supports endangered species or protects ecosystems, so we can't definitively say if he cares about conservation based on this rule alone.\n\nHowever, since we know Russell works with governments and is knowledgeable about the environment, and we know that those who work with governments are either knowledgeable about the environment or care about conservation, we can conclude that Russell either cares about conservation or is knowledgeable about the environment.\n\nThe conclusion states that Russell is an effective advocate.  We don't have enough information to determine if this is true or false.  We know he works with governments and is knowledgeable about the environment, but effectiveness as an advocate depends on many other factors. \n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>C</answer><end_of_answer>",
