Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nIf Ashlynn develops resilience, then she achieves success.\nAshlynn does not achieve success.\nIf Ashlynn experiences failure, then she is either someone who learns from mistakes or faces life challenges, but not both.\nIf Ashlynn faces life challenges, then she either develops resilience or has a supportive family (or both).\nBuster either lacks motivation or struggles with decisions.\nAshlynn either lacks motivation or struggles with decisions.\nAshlynn does not struggle with decisions.\nIf Ashlynn has a supportive family, then she either becomes dependent or becomes independent (or both, as evidenced by her transformation).\nIf Ashlynn values her loved ones, then she feels secure and has a supportive family.\nIf Ashlynn takes risks, then she either faces life challenges or builds confidence (but not both).\nHaven experiences failure.\nAshlynn either learns from mistakes or avoids risks, but not both.\nAshlynn avoids risks.\nAshlynn experiences failure.\nIf someone takes calculated risks, then they value feedback and learn from mistakes.\nAshlynn has low self-esteem.\nIf Ashlynn becomes dependent, then she either lacks motivation or has low self-esteem (but not both).\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAshlynn does not become independent.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ashlynn does not become independent.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>"
