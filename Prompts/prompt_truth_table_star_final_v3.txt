Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.

(A) True
(B) False
(C) Uncertain

<truth_table>
Let:
    T: Thor is happy
    H: The Hulk is angry
    A: The Hulk wakes up
    B: A bridge is broken
    C: Peter Parker is a civilian
    S: Peter Parker is a superhero
    U: Peter Parker wears a uniform
Premises:
    S ∨ C
    The Hulk is a destroyer (assumed true)
    H → A
    A → B
    Thor is a god
    T → B
    A god is not a destroyer
    S → U
    B → ¬C
    T → H
Logical chain (assuming T = True):
    T = True
    → From (10): H = True
    H = True
    → From (3): A = True
    A = True
    → From (4): B = True
    B = True and given Hulk is a destroyer
    → From (9): C = False
    From (1): S ∨ C must be true; since C is False, S = True
    S = True
    → From (8): U = True
Truth Table (for T = True):
| T (Thor is happy) | H (The Hulk is angry) | A (The Hulk wakes up) | B (A bridge is broken) | C (Peter Parker is a civilian) | S (Peter Parker is a superhero) | U (Peter Parker wears a uniform) |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| True              | True                  | True                  | True                   | False                           | True                              | True                              |

<premises>
All philosophers reason.
Some sophists reason.
All who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood.
Nobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect.
The theistic God is morally perfect.
The theistic God is a sophist.

<conclusion>
The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.

Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.

(A) True
(B) False
(C) Uncertain

<truth_table>
Let:
    P: God is a philosopher
    R: God reasons
    D: God can distinguish truth from falsehood
    M: God is morally perfect
    S: God is a sophist
Premises for God:
    If God is a philosopher, then God reasons. (P → R)
    (Some sophists reason; does not force God to reason.)
    If God reasons, then God can distinguish truth from falsehood. (R → D)
    If God can distinguish truth from falsehood, then God is not morally perfect. (D → ¬M)
    God is morally perfect. (M is True)
    God is a sophist. (S is True)
Logical chain:
    From (5) M = True.
    From (4), if D were True then M would be False; therefore, D must be False.
    From (3), if R were True then D would be True; therefore, R must be False.
    From (1), if P were True then R would be True; therefore, P must be False.
    Given (6), S = True.
Truth Table (for god):
| P (Philosopher) | R (Reasons) | D (Distinguishes truth) | M (Morally Perfect) | S (Sophist) | S ∧ P (Sophist and Philosopher) |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| False           | False       | False                   | True                | True        | False                           |

William Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. 
The University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. 
William Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. 
People who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.

<question>
Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.
</question> 
<options>
(A) True
(B) False
(C) Uncertain
</options>
<truth_table>
Let:
    W: William Dickinson attended Westminster School for high school.
    E: William Dickinson attended the University of Edinburgh.
    U: The University of Edinburgh is located in the United Kingdom (Given explicitly, so U = True).
    L: Westminster School is located in the United Kingdom (Not explicitly stated; uncertain).
Premises:
    William Dickinson attended Westminster School for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.
    The University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom.
    William Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs.
    People who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university, which translates to L ∧ U.
Logical Chain:
    From (2), we know U = True.
    However, L is not explicitly given by the premises; although implied by context, it remains uncertain.
    Therefore, since U = True but L is uncertain, the conjunction L ∧ U is uncertain.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| L (Westminster School in UK) | U (University of Edinburgh in UK) | L ∧ U (Both in UK) |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| True                         | True                               | True               |
| False                        | True                               | False              |
