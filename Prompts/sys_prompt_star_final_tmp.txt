	Use <code> if your reasoning involves code or pseudocode. The code must start with <code> and end with </code>. The code should not in markdown formate.
	Use <truth_table> if your reasoning involves logical analysis or constructing a truth table. The chain-of-thought must start with <truth_table> and end with </truth_table>. The content between these tags should be a generated truth table or the whole process of generating truth table.

2. After your reasoning process, output your final answer enclosed within an <answer> tag.
