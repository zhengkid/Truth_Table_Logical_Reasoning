You will be provided with a logical reasoning problem. Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. 


Instructions for the translation:

  1.	Import Z3
      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:
        from z3 import *
      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.
  2.	Define the Domain (Sorts)
      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:
        Person = DeclareSort('Person')
      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:
        x = Int('x')
        y = Real('y')
      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.
  3.  Declare Constants and Variables
      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., "Peter"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:
        p = Const('p', Person)  # for "Peter"
      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:
        x = Const('x', Person)
      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for "Michael").
  4. Define Predicates or Functions
      - For each statement like "x grows vegetables," "x has ample space," or "x is a young working professional," create a Boolean-valued function:
        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())
        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())
        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())
      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.
  5. Initialize the Solver
      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:
        s = Solver()
  6. Encode and Add the Premises
      - For each natural-language premise of the form "For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence]," you can write:
        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))
      - If you have direct facts like "Peter is a neighbor of Michael," add them as simple constraints:
        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))
      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.
  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation
      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:
        - Check negation C:
          solver.push()
          solver.add(Not(conclusion))
          result_neg = solver.check()
          solver.pop()
          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.
        - Check C:
          solver.push()
          solver.add(conclusion)
          result_pos = solver.check()
          solver.pop()
          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).
        - Combine the Results:
          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. 
          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.
          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).
          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.
  8. Derive the Final Outcome
      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:
        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown
        if result_neg == unsat:
            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true
            print("Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.")
            result = 'True'
        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:
            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false
            print("Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.")
            result = 'False'
        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:
            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain
            print("Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).")
            result = 'Uncertain'
        else:
            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario
            print("Unexpected or unknown result.")
            result = 'Unknown'


he premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.
