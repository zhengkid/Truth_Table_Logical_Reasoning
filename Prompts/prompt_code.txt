You will be provided with an input text. Your task is to translate this input text into Python code. You will first see two examples, and then you will be asked to translate a new input into Python code following a similar style.

Instructions for the translation:

	1.	All methods of a class should only contain a pass statement.
	2.	Methods should not contain any other statements.
	3.	Classes should not have an __init__ method.
	4.	Classes should not store any data.

An example begins with the text "<EXAMPLE n>" and ends with "<EXAMPLE n>", where "n" is the number of the example. Similarly, the text will start and end with <TEXT> and <\TEXT>, and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and <\PYTHON>.

Note: The Python code does not need to solve the problem described in the text; it only needs to translate the text into Python code.

<EXAMPLE 1>

<TEXT>
There are six types of wild turkeys: Eastern wild turkey, Osceola wild turkey, Gould’s wild turkey, Merriam’s wild turkey, Rio Grande wild turkey, and Ocellated wild turkey.
Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey.
Tom is not an Osceola wild turkey.
Tom is not a Gould's wild turkey.
Tom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey.
Tom is a wild turkey.

<EXAMPLE 2>
Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.
The Hulk is a destroyer.
The Hulk wakes up when he is angry.
If the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.
Thor is a god.
Thor will break a bridge when he is happy.
A god is not a destroyer.
Peter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.
Peter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.
If Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.
