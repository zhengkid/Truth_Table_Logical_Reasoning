You will be provided with an input text. Your task is to convert the information from the text into a logical truth table. The truth table will represent the possible combinations of conditions described in the text and indicate whether each combination satisfies the constraints provided. You will first see three examples, and then you will be asked to generate the truth table for a new input following a similar style.


Instructions for generating truth tables:

	1.	Define Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.
	2.	Enumerate Selective Combinations: 
			2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.
			2.2. Avoid generating all possible combinations by leveraging logical dependencies or simplifying constraints.
			2.3. Use methods like constraint propagation or incremental combination generation to reduce unnecessary rows.
	3.	Validate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.
	4.	Format: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.

An example begins with the text "<EXAMPLE n>" and ends with "<EXAMPLE n>", where "n" is the number of the example. Similarly, the text will start and end with <TEXT> and <\TEXT>, and the truth table will start and end with <TRUTH TABLE> and <\TRUTH TABLE>.


<EXAMPLE 1>

Tom is not an Osceola wild turkey.
Tom is not a Gould's wild turkey.
Tom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey.
