Below are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:

<EXAMPLE 1>
<premises>
Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.
The Hulk is a destroyer.
The Hulk wakes up when he is angry.
If the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.
Thor is a god.
Thor will break a bridge when he is happy.
A god is not a destroyer.
Peter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.
Peter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.
If Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.
</premises>
<conclusion>
If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.
</conclusion>
<question>
Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.
</question> 
<options>
(A) True
(B) False
(C) Uncertain
