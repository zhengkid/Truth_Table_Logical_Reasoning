The statement "If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform." can be expressed as: Happy(Thor) → WearsUniform(PeterParker)

Checking the Truth Table:
	1. For all validated rows where Happy(Thor) = Yes, we observe that WearsUniform(PeterParker) = Yes.
	2. For rows where Happy(Thor) = No, the implication holds true because the premise is false, making the statement valid by definition.

Therefore, the Answer is (A).

<Answer>
Definitions:

	3. Reason(x): x can reason.
	4. DistinguishTruthFalsehood(x): x can distinguish truth from falsehood.
	5. MorallyPerfect(x): x is morally perfect.

Truth Table(All Validated Rows):

| Philosopher(x) | Sophist(x) | Reason(x) | DistinguishTruthFalsehood(x) | MorallyPerfect(x) | TheisticGod(x) | Valid |
|----------------|------------|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| No             | Yes        | No       | Yes                          | No                | Yes            | Yes   |


The statement "The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher." can be expressed as: ∀x TheisticGod(x) → Sophist(x) ∧ Philosopher(x)

Checking the Truth Table:
	1. For all validated rows where TheisticGod(x) = Yes, we observe that Philosopher(x) = No.
	2. For rows where TheisticGod(x) = No, the implication holds true because the premise is false, making the statement valid by definition.

Therefore, the Answer is (B).
