</Truth Table>
The statement "If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform." can be expressed as: Happy(Thor) → WearsUniform(PeterParker)
Checking the Truth Table:
	1. For all validated rows where Happy(Thor) = Yes, we observe that WearsUniform(PeterParker) = Yes.
	2. For rows where Happy(Thor) = No, the implication holds true because the premise is false, making the statement valid by definition.
Therefore, the Answer is (A).

Checking the Truth Table:
	1. For all validated rows where TheisticGod(x) = Yes, we observe that Philosopher(x) = No.
	2. For rows where TheisticGod(x) = No, the implication holds true because the premise is false, making the statement valid by definition.
Therefore, the Answer is (B).
