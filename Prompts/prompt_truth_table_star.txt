Reasoning:
1. Premises confirm that William Dickinson is a politician and attended Westminster School for high school and the University of Edinburgh for university.
2. LocatedIn(UnivOfEdinburgh, UK) is explicitly True.
3. However, there is no explicit premise confirming LocatedIn(WestminsterSchool, UK). This variable remains uncertain, even though common knowledge might suggest otherwise.
4. As LocatedIn(WestminsterSchool, UK) is uncertain, the overall truth of whether William Dickinson attended schools located in the UK is also uncertain.

Therefore, the Answer is (C).
