You will be provided with an input text that consists of Premises and Conclusions. Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a PYTHON CODE that related to the premises and conclusion. Using the PYTHON CODE, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. You will first see three examples, followed by a new input question that you will solve in a similar style. Examples are enclosed within <EXAMPLE n> and </EXAMPLE n>, where n denotes the example number. The premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Python Codes, enclosed in <Python> and </Python>. 2. the answer based on the Python Codes. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.
