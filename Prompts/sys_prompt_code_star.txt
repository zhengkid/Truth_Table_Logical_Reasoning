You will be provided with an input text. Your task is to translate this input text into Python code. You will first see three examples, and then you will be asked to translate a new input into Python code following a similar style. An example begins with the text "<EXAMPLE n>" and ends with "<EXAMPLE n>", where "n" is the number of the example. Similarly, the text will start and end with <TEXT> and <\TEXT>, and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and <\PYTHON>.
