Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, it is also a company.\n\nStep 2:  We also know that \"All business organizations are legal entities\" and \"All legal entities are created under law\".  Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a company, it is a legal entity, and if it is a legal entity, it is created under law.\n\nStep 3:  The premise states \"All legal entities have legal obligations\". Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity, it has legal obligations.\n\nStep 4:  Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, it is both created under law and has legal obligations.\n\nStep 5: The conclusion states \"If the Harvard Weekly Book club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law\".  Since we have established in step 4 that if it's a private company, it is both, this statement is true. \n\n\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",
