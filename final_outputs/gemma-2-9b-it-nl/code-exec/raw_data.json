People who eat salads regularly are health-conscious. People who are health-conscious fulfill their daily nutritional intakes. And people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious homes.\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, if Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious home or not, the conclusion that she visits the gym at least once a day is uncertain.

People who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits (premise).  This means Taylor is conscious about her health and eating habits, which contradicts the part of Possibility 1 stating she disregards her physical well-being. This contradiction makes Possibility 1 impossible.\n\n   -  **Possibility 2:** This possibility states Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home.  The conclusion also states she does not visit the gym at least once a day.  We need to check if this is true.\n\nStep 3:  We know that all people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes (premise).  Therefore, if Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day, she does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes.\n\nStep 4:  The premise states \"If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\"  This means that if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.\n\nStep 5:  Combining Step 3 and Step 4, we see that Taylor cannot both not visit the gym at least once a day and fulfill her daily nutritional intakes. \n\nStep 6:  Since Possibility 2 is the only remaining possibility, and it leads to a contradiction if Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day, we can conclude that Taylor must visit the gym at least once a day.\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, the conclusion \"Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day\" is false.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",
