Therefore, this category is impossible.\n\nStep 3:  The second category is that Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not clean.\n\n    *  This means he is not a clumsy foodie (since that's defined as spilling a lot).\n    *  He is not clean, and therefore does not value order and spotlessness (from the premises).\n    *  This also means his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness (from the premise that all people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness value it themselves).\n\nStep 4:  Therefore, Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie and have a family that prioritizes order and spotlessness.
