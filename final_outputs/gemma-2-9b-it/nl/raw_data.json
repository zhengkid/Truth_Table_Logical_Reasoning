This tells us that appropriateness for all ages implies suitability for children without parental guidance.\n2. **Premise 2:** If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents. This means that excessive content prevents children from watching without guidance.\n3. **Premise 3:** If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages. This links the General Audience rating to suitability for all ages.\n4. **Premise 4:** All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience. This connects family-friendly animated films to the General Audience rating.\n5. **Premise 5:** All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.

Therefore, Hachi cannot be a family-friendly animated film AND contain excessive content.\n* **If Hachi is appropriate for all ages:** This aligns with premise 1, meaning children could watch it without parental guidance.
