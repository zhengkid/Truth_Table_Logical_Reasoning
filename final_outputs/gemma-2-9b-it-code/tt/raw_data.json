Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>.

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>.

We need to evaluate this statement based on the premises.\n\nWe start by simplifying the premises using the following equivalences:\n\n* \u00ac(A(x) \u2227 M(x)) is equivalent to \u00acA(x) \u2228 \u00acM(x)\n* \u00ac(A(x) \u2228 L(x)) is equivalent to \u00acA(x) \u2227 \u00acL(x)\n\nUsing these equivalences, the first premise becomes: \u00acA(x) \u2228 \u00acM(x) \u2192 \u00acA(x) \u2227 \u00acL(x). This is the key premise that relates to the conclusion.\n\nWe then consider the second premise, P(Tom). This tells us that Tom is a pet owner. From the premises, we know that all pet owners are animal lovers (L(x) if P(x)). Therefore, if Tom is a pet owner, he is also an animal lover.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion. We need to check if the following statement is true, false, or uncertain: If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.\n\nWe can do this by considering the possible truth values of A(Tom) and M(Tom). \n\n* **Case 1: A(Tom) is True and M(Tom) is True:**\n    * This case is ruled out by the first premise: \u00ac(A(Tom) \u2227 M(Tom)) \u2192 \u00ac(A(Tom) \u2228 L(Tom)). \n* **Case 2: A(Tom) is True and M(Tom) is False:**\n    * This case also violates the first premise.\n* **Case 3: A(Tom) is False and M(Tom) is True:**\n    * This case satisfies the condition \u00ac(A(Tom) \u2227 M(Tom)) but violates the conclusion because Tom is an animal lover (from P(Tom)).\n* **Case 4: A(Tom) is False and M(Tom) is False:**\n    * This case satisfies both the condition \u00ac(A(Tom) \u2227 M(Tom)) and the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (B).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>.
