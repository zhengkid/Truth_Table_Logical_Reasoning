Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nYumpuses are metallic.\nYumpuses are wumpuses.\nEvery wumpus is nervous.\nEvery wumpus is a zumpus.\nEvery zumpus is not sour.\nZumpuses are numpuses.\nEach numpus is kind.\nNumpuses are rompuses.\nRompuses are small.\nEvery rompus is an impus.\nEvery impus is not opaque.\nImpuses are dumpuses.\nJompuses are not small.\nDumpuses are not dull.\nEach dumpus is a vumpus.\nEach vumpus is orange.\nEach vumpus is a tumpus.\nStella is a yumpus.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nStella is not small.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true or false?
