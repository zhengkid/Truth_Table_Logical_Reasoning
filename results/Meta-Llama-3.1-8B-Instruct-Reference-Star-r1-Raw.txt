Premise 6 implies that Rockie is calm.\n3. Premise 4 implies that if Rockie is skittish, it cannot be calm.\n4. Since Rockie is calm, it cannot be skittish.\n5. Premise 2 implies that some turtles can be spotted near the campus, but it does not imply that all turtles can be spotted near the campus. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Rockie is a cute turtle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Uncertain.\n\nNote: Although the answer is uncertain, the statement \"If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle\" is false, because it is impossible for Rockie to be a skittish turtle if it is calm.",

Premises confirm that Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.\n2. Premises also confirm that Coco Gauff is either a female or male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n3. From premise 3, we know that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. Since Coco Gauff might be a female player, it is possible that Coco Gauff lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n4. If Coco Gauff lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, then she is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, which makes her one of the most active players in major tennis.\n5. Now we have two possibilities:\n    a. Coco Gauff lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, and in this case, she is indeed both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.\n    b. Coco Gauff did not lose to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. In this case, we still don't know whether Coco Gauff is a female or male player, but we do know that she is not a female player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n6. Given that Coco Gauff is a male player or did not lose to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, we can't determine whether Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.\n7. Therefore, the statement \"Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis\" is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

However, this does not impact the original question, which asks whether 1984 is not a streaming service.\n3. The truth table also shows that if 1984 is not a streaming service, then it is not a hardcover book, but this is not relevant to the original question.\n4. To resolve the question, we need to examine the premises more closely.\n5. Premise 5 (Is1984StreamingService \u2192 Is1984HardcoverBook) implies that if 1984 is a streaming service, then it is a hardcover book.\n6. However, this does not mean that 1984 is a streaming service; it only means that if it is a streaming service, then it is a hardcover book.\n7. Since we do not have any information about 1984 being a streaming service, we cannot conclude that it is not a streaming service.\n\nTo make a definitive conclusion, we would need additional premises or information about 1984.\n\nHowever, we can make a logical conclusion using the provided premises.\n\nFrom Premise 3 (AllStreamingServicesAreDigitalMedia), we can infer that if 1984 is a streaming service, then it is digital media.\n\nFrom Premise 1 (NoDigitalMediaAreAnalog), we can infer that if 1984 is digital media, then it is not analog media.\n\nFrom Premise 2 (EveryPrintedTextIsAnalogMedia), we can infer that if 1984 is not analog media, then it is not a printed text.\n\nFrom Premise 4 (IsHardcoverBook(x) \u2192 IsPrintedText(x)), we can infer that if 1984 is not a printed text, then it is not a hardcover book.\n\nHowever, we are still left with uncertainty about whether 1984 is a streaming service.\n\nThe provided information does not allow us to conclusively determine whether 1984 is a streaming service or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (C) Uncertain.\n\nNote: This conclusion is based on the provided premises and may not be the only possible conclusion.

However, if Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth, then he has siblings who were born together, but that would mean he lives with strangers (LivesWithStrangers(Luke) = Yes), which is not the case since we know he does not live with strangers.\n4. So, in both cases, we know Luke does not complain about annoying siblings.\n5.

If Windy is not taller than Michael, but Peter is taller than Michael, then Peter cannot block Windy's shooting.\n4. If Windy is taller than Michael, Michael cannot block Windy's shooting because Michael cannot block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\n5. Windy can jump when shooting, so Windy is a great shooter, but this does not affect the ability of Peter to block Windy's shooting.\n6. Since there is no explicit premise confirming Windy's height comparison to Michael, the overall truth of whether Peter can block Windy's shooting is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

Since Rock is Peter's pet (premise 7), Rock must be either a monkey or a bird.\n\nFrom premise (8), we know that Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. \n\nNow, let's consider the fact that Rock cannot be a monkey because monkeys are mammals (premise 2) and Rock cannot breathe (premise 8), which contradicts premise (5) which states that all animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.\n\nSo, Rock cannot be a monkey because it cannot breathe. However, we still have to determine whether Rock is a bird or not.\n\nIf Rock is a bird, then it must be able to fly (premise 4) and have wings (premise 6). However, premise (8) already states that Rock can fly or cannot breathe. This creates a logical contradiction because if Rock can fly, it must have wings, but premise (8) does not explicitly state that Rock has wings.\n\nGiven the logical contradiction above and the fact that Rock cannot be a monkey, we are left with uncertainty regarding whether Rock is a bird or not.\n\nHowever, the question does not ask whether Rock is a bird or not, but rather whether Rock is a monkey. Since we have determined that Rock cannot be a monkey, the statement \"Rock is a monkey\" is false.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (B).",

From premise 1, since John does not have wedding plans when he is engaged, Engaged(x) cannot be true. \n5. From premise 2, since John makes wedding plans when he invites others to come to their ceremony, WeddingPlanner(x) cannot be true when WeddingPlanner(x) is false; otherwise, it would contradict premise 2.\n6. From premise 4, since John has a larger family when he has a well-attended wedding, LargerFamily(x) cannot be true when WellAttended(x) is false; otherwise, it would contradict premise 4.\n7. From premise 6, since John has a larger family when he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony, LargerFamily(x) cannot be true when InvitesFriends(x) is true; otherwise, it would contradict premise 6.\n8. From premise 7, since John has a well-attended wedding when he invites others to come to their ceremony, WellAttended(x) cannot be false when InvitesOthers(x) is true; otherwise, it would contradict premise 3.\n9.

We need to use the premises to derive more information.\n\nPremises:\n1. If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.\n2. If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.\n3. If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.\n4. All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.\n5. All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.\n6. \u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is a film.\n7. \u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages.\n\nPremise 7 implies that \u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. If it is a family-friendly animated film, then it is rated General Audience (Premise 4). If it is not a family-friendly animated film, then it must be appropriate for people of all ages.\n\nFrom Premise 3, if a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages. This implies that if \u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.\n\nHowever, from Premise 1, if a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents. Therefore, if \u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is rated General Audience, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.\n\nPremise 6 implies that all movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films. However, there is no information about whether \u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is in the Frozen series.\n\nSince there is no explicit information about whether \u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is in the Frozen series or not, we cannot conclude that it is not rated General Audience.\n\nHowever, if we assume that \u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is not in the Frozen series (and therefore not a family-friendly animated film), then it must be appropriate for people of all ages. If it is not rated General Audience, then we cannot derive any information about it.\n\nTherefore, the truth of whether \u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is rated General Audience is uncertain.\n\nThe answer is (C).",

Premises confirm that aurochs are animals and that Heck cattle are animals.\n2. Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs.\n3. Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals, which may include aurochs.\n4. However, there is no explicit premise confirming that aurochs are extinct. This variable remains uncertain.\n5. If aurochs resemble extinct animals, then it is possible for them to be extinct.\nHowever, it is not necessarily true that aurochs are extinct. \nThey could be a species of animal that has been domesticated and is not extinct.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

Premises confirm that all organic compounds are chemical compounds, all hydrocarbons are organic compounds, all organic compounds contain carbon, and no chemical compounds contain only one element.\n2. We can infer that the mixture is either a chemical compound or an alkane, as it has the properties of both.\n3. If the mixture contains only one element, it cannot be a chemical compound, as no chemical compounds contain only one element.\n4. If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, it cannot be a chemical compound, as it would have to contain only one element, which contradicts the premise that no chemical compounds contain only one element.\n5. However, we cannot conclude that the mixture is not an alkane in this case, as we cannot directly infer that the mixture is not an alkane from the premises.\n6. The mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element, as this would contradict the premise that no chemical compounds contain only one element.\n7. Therefore, if the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, we can conclude that it is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane, but we cannot conclude that it is not an alkane.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (B)",

Yuri does not activate his leg muscles (\u00acActivateLeg(Yuri))\n6. From steps 2-4, Yuri must be a professional basketball player (LeapIntoAir(Yuri) \u2192 ProfessionalBasketballPlayer(Yuri))\n7. Yuri is either an American professional basketball player or a non-American professional basketball player (\u2203y (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer(y) \u2227 AmericanNational(y)) \u2228 \u2203y (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer(y) \u2227 \u00acAmericanNational(y)))\n8. If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, Yuri must be a professional basketball player (\u2203y (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer(y) \u2227 \u00acAmericanNational(y)) \u2192 ProfessionalBasketballPlayer(Yuri))\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

However, there is no explicit premise confirming that KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n7. As there is no explicit premise confirming KiKi is terricolous or has legs, whether KiKi is terricolous or has legs is uncertain.\n8. However, even if KiKi is terricolous or has legs, we cannot determine whether the statement is true or not, as we do not know if KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n9. Therefore, the overall truth of whether KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",
