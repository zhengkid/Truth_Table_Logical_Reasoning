Given that Bonnie either attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student, or not, we can infer that there are two possible scenarios for Bonnie:\n   1. AttendAndEngage(Bonnie, school events) and Student(Bonnie, school) are both true.\n   2. AttendAndEngage(Bonnie, school events) and Student(Bonnie, school) are both false.\n2. If AttendAndEngage(Bonnie, school events) and Student(Bonnie, school) are both true, then PerformInSchoolTalentShows(Bonnie, often) must be true.\n3. However, if AttendAndEngage(Bonnie, school events) and Student(Bonnie, school) are both false, then PerformInSchoolTalentShows(Bonnie, often) can be either true or false, as it is not a requirement to be a student or engaged with school events to perform in talent shows.\n4. Given that the first scenario definitely results in PerformInSchoolTalentShows(Bonnie, often) being true, but the second scenario leaves it uncertain, the overall truth of whether Bonnie performs in school talent shows often is also uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

As James is in the UK (by default, not stated in the premises, but since it is not explicitly mentioned that he is in another country), he cannot work remotely from home.\n6.

If he schedules meetings with customers, then he must have lunch in the company building.\n9. Therefore, James does have lunch in the company.\n\nHowever, we can show that the statement is false by using a row where James is a manager, but does not go to the company building.

Therefore, Marvin must be from neither Earth nor Mars.\n4. Given that Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial (by the last premise).\n5. Consider the case where Marvin is an extraterrestrial and not from Mars. Then Marvin is from somewhere other than Earth and Mars, which still satisfies Marvin being neither a human nor from Mars.\n6.

The premises confirm that Djokovic is a professional tennis player, an athlete, and possibly a Grand Slam champion.\n2. The premise \"If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous\" supports that Djokovic is famous.\n3. The premise \"If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid\" does not directly apply to Djokovic, but since we know Djokovic is famous and also an athlete, we can infer that Djokovic is well-paid.\n4. However, there is no direct information confirming that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion. The only information about Djokovic is that he is a professional tennis player, and being a professional tennis player does not necessarily make him a Grand Slam champion.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

We don't know if Djokovic is a famous athlete. If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.

However, we know that if KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not a growth stock (Premise 1 and Premise 7).\n5.

Let's denote the following expressions:\n   - W = Hannah works in student jobs on campus\n   - N = Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition\n   - T = Hannah orders takeout frequently in college\n   - D = Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes\n   - P = Hannah is a picky eater\n   - E = Hannah spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\n5. From the premises, we can derive the following implications:\n   - W \u2192 N (If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition)\n   - T \u2192 W (If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus)\n   - D \u2192 \u00acP (If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters)\n   - D \u2192 E (If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls)\n6. Since Hannah is at Mary's school (H), we can apply the premises to her situation. We know that W (Hannah works in student jobs on campus) and we need to determine whether N (Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition).\n7. From premise 6, we have W \u2192 N. Therefore, if Hannah works in student jobs on campus, then she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. Since W is true for Hannah, we can infer that N is also true.\n8. However, premise 7 also states that if Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. This creates a contradiction, because we have already determined that Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n9. The contradiction suggests that our initial assumption about Hannah needing to earn money to help pay for her college tuition might be incorrect.\n10. However, since we have not explicitly ruled out the possibility that Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, the statement \"Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition\" remains uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

Since the Hamden Plaza store has a rating greater than four (or is popular among local residents), then it has not received many negative reviews.\n8.

From the premises, we know that people who spill a lot of food on their clothing are not notably tidy.\n2. We also know that all clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\n3. However, we cannot conclude that Peter is a clumsy foodie because there is no explicit information about Peter's eating habits.\n4. We do know that Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.\n5. If Peter is a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, then he is not notably tidy. But this does not necessarily mean that Peter is not tidy.\n6. We also know that if people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\n7. From the premises, we can conclude that Peter is cleanly and values order and spotlessness. This makes Peter notably tidy.\n8. However, the statement \"Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly\" does not necessarily mean that Peter is not tidy.\n9. In fact, the statement \"Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly\" is consistent with Peter being notably tidy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) True, but note that this conclusion is based on the information given and does not necessarily reflect the actual state of Peter's tidiness.",

However, we cannot directly determine whether John is engaged or not, but we can derive some possible scenarios.\n3. If John is engaged, then he does not make wedding plans or invite friends to their ceremony (Premise 5).\n4. But if John has a larger family, then either he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony (Premise 7).\n5.

Combining these two premises, we get:\n\t* If John is engaged, then he does not have a larger family (since he does not make wedding plans or invite friends to their ceremony).\n\t* But if John has a larger family, then either he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.\n7. This implies that if John is engaged, then he does not have a larger family, and therefore either he does not have a well-attended wedding or does not invite friends to their ceremony.\n8. However, we cannot directly conclude whether John is engaged or not, since we do not have enough information to determine whether he has a larger family or not.\n9.

However, from premise 2, we know that making wedding plans implies inviting others to the ceremony, which we've already established John doesn't do.\n5. Therefore, if John had a larger family, his wedding would be well-attended, but this contradicts premise 3 which states that anyone with a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony, which we know John doesn't do.\n6.

Premises confirm that None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department, and James doesn't work in the library.\n2. The premises also confirm that All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library.\n3. Since James doesn't work in the library and James doesn't have a part-time job, it must be the case that James is not among the students with part-time jobs offered by the university.\n4. The only remaining row is when x is James, and FromComputerScienceDepartment(x) is No, WorksInLibrary(x) is Uncertain, HasPartTimeJob(x) is Uncertain, TakingDatabaseCourse(x) is No, TakesClassWithProfessorDavid(x) is Uncertain, WorksInLab(x) is Uncertain, and Student(x) is Yes.\n5. However, we know that James works in the lab, so WorksInLab(x) must be Yes.\n6. Also, we know that James takes a class with Professor David, so TakesClassWithProfessorDavid(x) must be Yes.\n7. With the additional information, the row becomes:\n| FromComputerScienceDepartment(x) | WorksInLibrary(x) | HasPartTimeJob(x) | TakingDatabaseCourse(x) | TakesClassWithProfessorDavid(x) | WorksInLab(x) | Student(x) | VALID |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|-----------|-------|\n| No                              | Uncertain         | Uncertain         | No                      | Yes                             | Yes          | Yes      | No    |\nHowever, this row is still invalid because it doesn't satisfy the condition that All students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course.\n\n8. Looking at the original premises, we can conclude that All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.\n9. We can also conclude that All students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course.\n10. With the above two premises, we can conclude that All students working in the lab are taking the database course.\n11. Now we know that James works in the lab and takes a class with Professor David, and from the premises, we can conclude that James is taking the database course.\n12. Furthermore, we know that all students taking the database course are from the computer science department, so James is from the computer science department.\n13. Now, we can conclude that James doesn't have a part-time job offered by the university because none of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department, and James is from the computer science department.\n14. However, we also know that James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university, which is a contradiction.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The final conclusion was incorrect. \n2. From the premises, we can conclude that James works in the lab and takes a class with Professor David. \n3. We also know that James doesn't work in the library or have a part-time job offered by the university. \n4. The premises also confirm that none of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department.\n5. However, we don't know if James is or isn't from the computer science department.\n6. If James is from the computer science department, then he must work in the library because none of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department.\n7. However, this is a contradiction because James doesn't work in the library.\n8. Therefore, James must not be from the computer science department.\n9. Since James takes a class with Professor David and isn't from the computer science department, we can't conclude that James has a part-time job offered by the university.\n10. However, we can conclude that James doesn't have a part-time job offered by the university.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

If George will not compose, George cannot compose.\n</Question> \n\nTo determine the truth of the statement, we need to use the premises to derive a conclusion. \n\nLet's consider the statement: If George will not compose, George cannot compose.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that if George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose. \n\nNow, let's assume that George will not compose. We need to find out what this implies about George's ability to compose.\n\nFrom premise 3, if George cannot compose, then he will not compose (this is the contrapositive). However, we are given that George will not compose, so this premise does not provide any new information.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if George likes music, he wants to compose. However, we do not know whether George likes music, so this premise does not provide any information about George's ability to compose.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if George has access to a program, he can compose. However, we do not know whether George has access to a program, so this premise does not provide any information about George's ability to compose.\n\nBased on the premises provided, we cannot determine whether George will not compose because he cannot compose or whether George will not compose for some other reason. Therefore, the statement \"If George will not compose, George cannot compose\" is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

However, the 7th premise, Some birds are hawks, is already proven true. Consequently, we can prove the 2nd premise, Some birds are birds, and the 9th premise, All birds are either some birds, or some other bird that is a hawk.\n\nNow, when Hawk(x) is Yes and Bird(x) is Yes, the 9th premise can be used to deduce that Bird(y) is Yes, where y is another bird. The 4th premise claims that Hawk(x) \u2192 \u00acSwim(x), implying that if x is a hawk, then x does not swim. However, since y is not a hawk, we cannot apply the 4th premise to y. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether y swims or not.\n\nHence, given the premises, it is uncertain whether all birds swim.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

Given the premise that Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither, we can see that the first option is impossible (since she would fulfill her daily nutritional intakes and therefore visit the gym at least once a day).\n3. Therefore, the only valid option is that Taylor did neither grow up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day.\n\nHowever, based on the given premises, we can see that there is no direct evidence to confirm whether Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home or whether she visits the gym at least once a day.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day\" is uncertain.\n\nThe Answer is (C).",

If KiKi is a dog, then KiKi barks, and the statement \"KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog\" would be False.\n4. However, if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog, the statement could be True.\n5. We need to determine if KiKi can be neither a dog nor bark.\n6. The premises state that Jane likes all animals that jump, and all animals that have legs jump.\n7. If KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps, and Jane likes KiKi.\n8. The premises also state that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.\n9. If KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs, and KiKi jumps, and Jane likes KiKi.\n10. However, the premises also state that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n11. This means that KiKi can be either terricolous or have legs.\n12. If KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs, and KiKi jumps, and Jane likes KiKi.\n13. In this case, the statement \"KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog\" is True.\n14. If KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps, and Jane likes KiKi.\n15. In this case, the statement \"KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog\" is True.\n16. However, there is no premise confirming that KiKi has legs or is terricolous.\n17. This means that KiKi may neither bark nor be a dog, and the statement \"KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog\" is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",
