If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either have lunch at home or work remotely from home.\n\nGiven the premises and truth table, we can see that if James is a manager or in other countries, he will not have lunch at home or work remotely from home. This is because if he is a manager, he will go to the company building, and if he is in other countries, he will work remotely from home, but not have lunch at home.\n\nHowever, this is not entirely accurate. If James is a manager, he will go to the company building, and there is a meeting scheduled with his customer, but he can still have lunch at home. Therefore, this part of the statement is uncertain.\n\n2. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.\n\nFrom the premises and truth table, we can see that if James has lunch at home or works remotely from home, he is not a manager, and he does not work in other countries. This is because if he has lunch at home, it means he does not go to the company building, so he cannot be a manager. And if he works remotely from home, it means he is in other countries, but not a manager.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of this statement is true.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the entire statement. The entire statement is uncertain because the first part is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",

Therefore, Marvin being from Mars implies Marvin is an extraterrestrial.\n2. Since Marvin is from Mars, this means Marvin is an alien from Mars (by premise 2).\n3. Premise 3 states that no extraterrestrials are human. This does not directly relate to Marvin, but it does help to confirm that extraterrestrial status is not equivalent to human status.\n4. Premise 4 states that all highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans. This is irrelevant to Marvin since he is not from Earth.\n5. Premise 6 implies Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither. However, this is a disjunctive statement, and since we already know Marvin is from Mars, this part of the statement can be ignored.\n6. Premise 7 states that if Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial. Since Marvin is from Mars (and not from Earth), this premise confirms that Marvin is an extraterrestrial.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that Marvin is indeed an extraterrestrial.

If Marvin is not from Mars, then he must be from Earth (EitherFromEarthAndMars(x) or NeitherFromEarthNorMars(x) implies EitherFromEarth(x) or NeitherFromEarth(x) implies FromMars(x) or FromEarth(x)).\n3. However, the premise \"If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial\" implies that if Marvin is not from Earth, then he is not human (NotFromEarth(x) implies NotHuman(x)).\n4. Combining steps 2 and 3, if Marvin is not from Mars, then he must be from Earth and therefore not human.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (B).",

This is a case of a negation of a negation, which can be tricky.\n\nTo determine the truth of the statement, we need to negate the whole statement.\n\nImperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile.\n\nThis statement is equivalent to:\n\nImperium has a feud with a professional wrestling stable that doesn't include Ivy Nile.\n\nOr:\n\nImperium has a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes someone other than Ivy Nile.\n\nWe can verify this using the following argument:\n\n1. Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine. (Premise)\n2. Diamond Mine includes Ivy Nile. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, Diamond Mine doesn't meet the condition of including someone other than Ivy Nile (which is a valid interpretation of the question).\n4. However, this doesn't necessarily mean Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes someone other than Ivy Nile. There might be other stables that meet this condition.\n\nGiven the information, we can't determine if there are other stables that meet this condition. However, we can say that the original statement \"Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile\" is false because it's equivalent to saying \"Imperium has a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes someone other than Ivy Nile\", which is true because Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (B).",

Therefore, Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 because she did not lose to Rafael Nadal.\n5. The premises also confirm that Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.\n6. Considering the current information, Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association and most active in major tennis.\n7. Additionally, Coco Gauff lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022.\n8.

As a result, we cannot conclude that Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).\nHowever, we can conclude that Coco Gauff is a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022, but the truth of whether Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis is uncertain.\n\nGiven the information in the premises, we can infer that Coco Gauff is a female tennis player. \n\nIf Coco Gauff is a female tennis player, then she is not a male tennis player. \nIf Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player, then she did not lose to Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros 2022. \nIf Coco Gauff did not lose to Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros 2022, then she is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal. \nIf Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then she is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. \n\nHowever, the premises confirm that Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 and lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, but we cannot conclude that Coco Gauff is not one of the most active players in major tennis.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis\" is uncertain.",

The premise \"The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana\" tells us that St Pierre is not in Montana. \n4. The premise \"White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.\" tells us that White Sulphur Springs and Butte are in the same state. Since we already know that White Sulphur Springs is in Montana, this means that Butte is also in Montana.\n5. The premise \"The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula\" tells us that Butte, Helena, and Missoula are in Montana.\n6. Since Butte is in Montana, and Bismarck can be in the same state as Butte, this means that Bismarck can be in Montana.\n7.

Since Ted is an alligator, IsAnAlligator(Ted) is explicitly True.\n2. As alligators are not domesticated animals, DomesticatedAnimals(Ted) is explicitly False.\n3.

When Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, Cows(Ted) is True.\n5. Given that all cows are domesticated animals, DomesticatedAnimals(Ted) is True when Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle.\n6. As some pets are Brown Swiss Cattle, Pets(Ted) is True when Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle.\n7. However, the truth of the statement \"If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet\" depends on the truth of BrownSwissCattleIsAkindOfCows(Ted).\n8. Given that Ted is an alligator, IsAnAlligator(Ted) is explicitly True.\n9. This makes the fourth row of the truth table invalid because IsAnAlligator(Ted) is not False when Ted is an alligator.\n10. The fifth row of the truth table is also invalid because IsAnAlligator(Ted) is not False when Ted is an alligator.\n11.

There is one such row in the truth table where Pets(Ted) is also True.\n13. In this row, the statement \"If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet\" is False.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (B).",

Premise 3 states that if Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n3. Therefore, Hannah cannot need to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n\nThis reasoning is only possible if the premises are True.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (B).\n(Please note that there is an inconsistency in premise 3 because it is contradictory.

It is also given that Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n4.

The premises provide information about animals, invertebrates, vertebrates, and bees.\n2. All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating, which means Harry, being a bee, also does not reproduce by male-and-female mating.\n3. All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. Therefore, bees, as animals with backbones, reproduce by male-and-female mating.\n4. This information, however, is contradictory, and thus the truth table cannot provide a complete or partial solution for all possible cases.\n5. Therefore, the Answer is (C).\n\nHowever, to provide a detailed proof, consider the following: \n\n1. If Harry is a bee, then he does not reproduce by male-and-female mating.\n2. Since all animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating, if Harry has a backbone, then he is not an animal.\n3. If Harry is not an animal, then he is not an invertebrate or a vertebrate.\n4. Therefore, if Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then he is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that Harry is a vertebrate and has a backbone, but is not an animal.

Premises confirm that Rock is a pet of Peter.\n2. Given that Rock can fly or Rock is a bird or Rock cannot breathe, we have three possibilities for Rock's properties.\n3. Since Rock cannot be a mammal, which is a necessary condition for it to be a monkey (premise 2), we can exclude the possibility that Rock is a monkey.\n4. As a result, premise 1 implies that Rock is an animal.\n5. Premise 6 implies that if Rock can fly, then it has wings.\n6. Premise 4 implies that if Rock is a bird, then it can fly, which in turn implies that it has wings.\n7. From premise 8, we know that Rock can fly or Rock is a bird or Rock cannot breathe. If Rock cannot breathe, we can conclude that Rock is not an animal (premise 5), which is a contradiction.\n8. Therefore, we conclude that Rock is either a bird or it can fly.\n9. In either case, Rock has wings.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (A).",

We previously concluded that InvitesOthersToCeremony(John) is true in rows 6, 7, and 8, but now we have concluded that InvitesOthersToCeremony(John) is false in these rows.

If George will not compose, George can not compose.\n\nAnswer:\nTo determine the truth of this statement, we need to analyze the possible scenarios where George will not compose.\n\nFrom the Truth Table, we can see that there are 8 scenarios where George will not compose:\n\n1. George likes music, wants to compose, but has no access to a program (row 4).\n2. George likes music, wants to compose, and has access to a program, but can't compose anyway (row 5).\n3. George likes music, but doesn't want to compose (row 6).\n4. George likes music, but has no access to a program (row 7).\n5. George doesn't like music, wants to compose, and has access to a program, but can't compose anyway (row 12).\n6. George doesn't like music, wants to compose, and has access to a program, but will not compose (row 13).\n7. George doesn't like music, wants to compose, and has no access to a program (row 14).\n8. George doesn't like music, doesn't want to compose, and has access to a program, but can't compose anyway (row 17).\n\nHowever, we can see that in none of these scenarios, George's inability to compose is due to a lack of ability to compose. In fact, in most of these scenarios, George can compose, but chooses not to (rows 4, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17).\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If George will not compose, George can not compose\" is false.\n\nThe Answer is (B).",

All birds are not hawks.\n2. Some birds are hawks.\n3. From premise 2, we know that some birds (which are hawks) do not swim.\n\nThe only way for the statement \"All birds swim\" to be true would be if every bird swims. However, since we know some birds do not swim (from premise 2), the statement \"All birds swim\" must be false.\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (B).",

The first premise states that some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.\n2. This implies that a show airing at 8 pm on Monday might or might not give out roses on TV.\n3. The second premise states that if a show gives out roses on TV, then it is an episode of The Bachelor.\n4. However, the third premise states that The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people, and the fourth premise states that all shows portraying real people are reality TV shows.\n5. Since Breaking Bad is a show that is not a reality TV show (fifth premise), it cannot be an episode of The Bachelor.\n6. Therefore, there is no evidence that Breaking Bad gives out roses on TV.\n7. As the statement \"Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm\" requires both Breaking Bad to be a TV show and roses to be given out on Monday at 8 pm, and we have found that roses are not given out on Monday at 8 pm, the statement cannot be determined to be true.\n8. However, we cannot confirm it to be false, as the truth table contains a set of rows where Breaking Bad is a TV show airing at 8 pm on Monday, but it does not give out roses.\n9. Therefore, the answer is (C).\n\nHowever, the full answer was not posed with the correct answer, so I will revise that here:\n\nThe correct answer is (C).",

From Definition 3, Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes if she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.\n2. From Definition 5, Taylor visits the gym at least once a day if she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.\n3. Therefore, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she visits the gym at least once a day.\n4. From Definition 2, Taylor eats salads regularly if she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.\n5. From Definition 1, Taylor is very conscious about her health and eating habits if she eats salads regularly.\n6. However, Taylor did neither grow up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, nor did she do neither.\n7. Therefore, Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home (from Definition 2 and Definition 3).\n8. Therefore, Taylor visits the gym at least once a day (from Definition 3 and Definition 5).\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (A).",

From premise 2, we know that the departure and arrival can not be at the same airport.\n2. If Susan flies to LGA airport (premise 1), then John can only fly from LGA airport if he does not fly to LGA airport (because they can't depart and arrive at the same airport).\n3. Therefore, premise 3 directly implies that John flies to LGA airport is uncertain (because he flies from LGA airport, but it is uncertain if he flies to it or not).\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (C).",
