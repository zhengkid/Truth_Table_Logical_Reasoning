Consider the Conclusion:**\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.\"\n\n*  We can rephrase this as: \n    * If KO is a growth stock, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.\n    * If KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.\n\n*  **Important:** The conclusion is using a conditional statement (\"If...then\").

Analyze the \"Then\" Part:**\n\n* The conclusion states that if KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it's neither a stock nor is its price volatile. \n* This statement is inherently contradictory.
