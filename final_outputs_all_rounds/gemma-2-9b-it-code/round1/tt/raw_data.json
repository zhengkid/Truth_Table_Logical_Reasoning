This means the conditional statement \"If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human\" is true.\n\n\n\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

Solo EVs are single-seat electric cars (SE(x) implies S(x)).\n4. If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce that:\n\n* If John's car is a Tesla Model 3 (T(J) is true), then it cannot be a single-seat electric car (S(J) is false) and must be able to transport multiple passengers (M(J) is true).\n* If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 (T(J) is false), then it cannot be both a single-seat electric car (S(J) is false) and a Tesla Model 3 (T(J) is false).\n\nThe truth table systematically explores all possible combinations of these conditions.  \n\nWe find that there are multiple scenarios where John's car could be a Solo EV (SE(J) is true), including cases where it is not a Tesla Model 3 and is not a single-seat electric car.  \n\n\n</Answer>",

The key observation is that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3 (P(x) is True), then it cannot be a single-seat electric car (Q(x) is False) based on Premise 2 and the rule derived from Premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the only scenario where John's car could be a Solo EV is if it is not a Tesla Model 3 and is a single-seat electric car (P(x) is False and Q(x) is True). However, Premise 5 states that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it cannot be a single-seat electric car. \n\nThis contradiction means that John's car cannot be a Solo EV, making the statement \"John's car is not a Solo EV\" true. \n\n\n\n</Answer>",

This translates to: `deadlyDisease(x) -> lowSurvivalRate(x)`\n   * **Premise 2:** Severe cancers are deadly diseases. This translates to: `severeCancer(x) -> deadlyDisease(x)`\n   * **Premise 3:** Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer. This translates to: `bileDuctCancer(x) -> severeCancer(x)`\n   * **Premise 4:** All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. (This premise doesn't directly relate to the conclusion, so we don't create a direct logical statement from it)\n   * **Premise 5:** Mild flu comes with a low survival rate. (This premise doesn't directly relate to the conclusion, so we don't create a direct logical statement from it)\n   * **Premise 6:** Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate. This translates to: `(bileDuctCancer(x) & lowSurvivalRate(x)) -> \u00accolorectalCancer(x)`\n\n2. **Deduction:**\n\n   We want to determine if `colorectalCancer(x)` is true or false based on the premises. To do this, we use the premises to deduce information about the properties of colorectal cancer.\n\n   * Since we know `severeCancer(x) -> deadlyDisease(x)`, and `deadlyDisease(x) -> lowSurvivalRate(x)`, we can infer that `severeCancer(x) -> lowSurvivalRate(x)`.\n\n   * We also know `bileDuctCancer(x) -> severeCancer(x)`.\n\n   * Combining these inferences, we can deduce that if something is a bile duct cancer, then it comes with a low survival rate.  \n\n   * However, Premise 6 states that colorectal cancer is *not* both a bile duct cancer and has a low survival rate. This means colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The conclusion is \"Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer\".  While we know that severe cancers are deadly and have a low survival rate, we cannot definitively conclude that colorectal cancer is a severe cancer. \n\n\n\n</Answer>",

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.
