Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll cats are mammals.\nSome pets are not mammals.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nNo pets are cats.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? No pets are cats.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAnimals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.\nAll animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. \nAll vertebrate animals have a backbone.\nAll bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.\nAll queen bees are bees.\nHarry is a bee.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>.
