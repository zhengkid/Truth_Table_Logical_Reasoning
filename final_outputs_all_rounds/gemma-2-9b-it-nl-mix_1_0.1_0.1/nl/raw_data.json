Therefore, all alkanes are chemical compounds.\n\nStep 3:  The premise states \"No chemical compounds contain only one element\".  Since alkanes are chemical compounds, they cannot contain only one element.\n\nStep 4:  The premise \"All organic compounds contain carbon\" tells us that alkanes, being organic compounds, must contain carbon.\n\nStep 5:  The conclusion states \"The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon\".  While we know alkanes contain carbon, we don't know for sure if the mixture is an alkane. The premise only tells us about the properties of alkanes, not about the composition of the mixture. \n\nStep 6:  The premise \"The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither\"  doesn't help us determine if the mixture is an alkane, as it doesn't relate to the properties of alkanes.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",
