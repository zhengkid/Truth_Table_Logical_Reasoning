We can use these premises to evaluate the statement \"Marvin is an alien.\"\n\n3. Consider the following possibilities:\n    - **Case 1:** Marvin is from Earth. \n        - If Marvin is from Earth, then he is a human (from the fourth premise).\n        - Humans are not extraterrestrials (from the third premise).\n        - Therefore, Marvin is not an alien.\n    - **Case 2:** Marvin is from Mars.\n        - If Marvin is from Mars, then he is an alien (from the second premise).\n    - **Case 3:** Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars.\n        - If Marvin is not from Earth, then he is an extraterrestrial (from the seventh premise).\n        - Extraterrestrials are aliens (from the first premise).\n        - Therefore, Marvin is an alien in this case.\n\n4. Therefore, the statement \"Marvin is an alien\" can be expressed as:\n    - Marvin is from Mars or Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars.\n\n5. The statement is true for Case 2 and Case 3.\n6. Therefore, the Answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

This means: \u00ac(Colorectal cancer is Bile duct cancer \u2227 Colorectal cancer has a low survival rate)\n5. Since Bile duct cancer is a deadly disease, it comes with a low survival rate. Therefore, we can rewrite the above statement as: \u00ac(Colorectal cancer is Bile duct cancer)\n6. Combining this with statement 3, we get: (Colorectal cancer is Cholangiocarcinoma) \u2227 \u00ac(Colorectal cancer is Bile duct cancer) \u2227 (Colorectal cancer is Mild flu)\n7. This statement is false because we cannot have both Colorectal cancer being Cholangiocarcinoma and not being Bile duct cancer.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the Answer is (B).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",
