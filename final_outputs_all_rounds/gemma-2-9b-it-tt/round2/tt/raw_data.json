Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPeople in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPeople in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\nPeople in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\nAll people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nAll young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. \nBonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. \nEveryone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. \nEmployees have lunch either in the company building or at home.\nIf an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.\nAll employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. \nNo managers work remotely from home. \nJames will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJames has lunch in the company.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? James has lunch in the company.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nWhen the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox. \nMonkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.\nHumans are mammals.\nMammals are animals.\nSymptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. \nPeople feel tired when they get the flu.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThere is an animal.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Your task is to determine whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain based on the premises. To achieve this, you will first generate a Truth Table that outlines the possible combinations of conditions described in the text. Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\n\"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.\nIf a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.\nIf and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.\nKaren does not download \"Black Mirror.\"\n\"Black Mirror\" is a Netflix show.\nIf Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n\"Black Mirror\" is popular.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? \"Black Mirror\" is popular.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3.

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2.

Using the truth table, you will then evaluate and determine the final answer. \n\nInstructions for generating truth tables:\n\n\t1.\tDefine Logical Predicates: Identify all key conditions and constraints from the text, and translate them into well-defined logical predicates.\n\t2.\tEnumerate Selective Combinations: \n\t\t\t2.1. Focus on relevant combinations of truth values that are critical for evaluating the constraints.\n\t3.\tValidate Rows: For each combination, determine whether it satisfies all constraints described in the text. Indicate this in a Valid column as Yes or No.\n\t4.\tFormat: The truth table should clearly label predicates, include all possible rows of truth value combinations, and provide a final validity evaluation for each row.\n\nThe premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes: 1. Definitions of logical predicates, enclosed in <Definitions> and </Definitions>. 2. A truth table, enclosed in <Truth Table> and </Truth Table>, showing relevant combinations of conditions and their validity. 3. A detailed explanation of how the conclusion was evaluated using the truth table. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNew Vessel Press is a publishing house specializing in translating foreign literature into English.\nAll of New Vessel Press's published books are in English.\nNeapolitan Chronicles is a book published by New Vessel Press.\nNeapolitan Chronicles was translated from Italian.\nPalace of Flies is a book published by New Vessel Press.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nHarry Potter was published by New Vessel Press.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
