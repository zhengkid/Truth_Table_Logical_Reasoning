This means if someone regularly drinks coffee, caffeine dependence is guaranteed.\n* **Premise 2:** People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both. This gives us three possibilities for why someone might not be drinking coffee regularly.\n* **Premise 3:** No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug. This means if someone doesn't want to be addicted, they must be aware of caffeine as a drug.\n* **Premise 4:** Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or she is not a student and is she aware that caffeine is a drug. This tells us about Rina's knowledge of caffeine.\n* **Premise 5:** Rina  is either a student who is dependent on caffeine, or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine. This tells us about Rina's caffeine dependence.\n\nStep 2:  We need to analyze the possibilities for Rina based on the premises:\n\n* **Scenario 1: Rina is a student unaware of caffeine as a drug.** \n    * This means she doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine (from Premise 3). \n* **Scenario 2: Rina is not a student and aware of caffeine as a drug.**\n    * This doesn't directly tell us if she wants to be addicted to caffeine.\n\nStep 3:  Combining the scenarios, we see that in both possibilities for Rina, she either doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine (Scenario 1) or we lack information about her desire for addiction (Scenario 2).\n\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can conclude that Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

This doesn't necessarily mean she's a toddler.\n\n* **Scenario 2: Nancy is not a pirate.**\n    * This means she must be young (Premise 5).\n    *  She could be a toddler (and therefore young) or not a toddler (and therefore a seafarer based on Premise 6).\n\nStep 3: Combining the possibilities, we see Nancy can be:\n\n*  A pirate\n*  A young, non-toddler seafarer\n*  A toddler\n\nShe cannot be both a young, non-toddler seafarer and a toddler, as those are mutually exclusive possibilities.\n\n\nStep 4:  The conclusion states Nancy is either both a pirate and a toddler, or neither a pirate nor a toddler.

The antecedent is \"Hamlet has either won a Hugo Award and is written by Tolkien, or neither has won a Hugo Award nor is written by Tolkien\". The consequent is \"Hamlet has neither won a Hugo Award nor is written by Neil Gaiman\".\n\nStep 2:  We need to analyze if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.  To do this, let's examine the possible scenarios within the antecedent:\n\n   * **Scenario 1: Hamlet has won a Hugo Award and is written by Tolkien.**  \n      -  We know \"All books written by Neil Gaiman have sold more than one thousand copies\" and \"Some books that have won Hugo Awards are written by Neil Gaiman\". \n      - It's possible for Hamlet to be both a Hugo Award winner and written by Tolkien, but this scenario doesn't automatically mean it's written by Neil Gaiman. \n\n   * **Scenario 2: Hamlet has not won a Hugo Award and is not written by Tolkien.**\n      - This scenario doesn't directly contradict the premises.\n\nStep 3: Since neither scenario within the antecedent's \"or\" statement  forces Hamlet to be written by Neil Gaiman, the conclusion that Hamlet has neither won a Hugo Award nor is written by Neil Gaiman cannot be definitively proven. \n\nStep 4: The premises don't provide enough information to establish a direct causal link between the antecedent and the consequent. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

This means if Jumbo is a living being, Jumbo cannot be both an elephant and a mammal.\n\nStep 5: The premise \"If Jumbo is sleepy, then Jumbo is either a baby elephant or a mammal\" is another conditional statement. It means if Jumbo is sleepy, then Jumbo must fall into one of those two categories.\n\nStep 6:  We don't know for sure if Jumbo is a living being. If Jumbo is *not* a living being, then the first conditional statement doesn't apply, and we can't definitively say Jumbo is not an elephant and mammal.\n\nStep 7:  If Jumbo *is* a living being, then the first conditional statement means Jumbo cannot be both an elephant and a mammal.  \n\nStep 8:  Combining steps 4 and 5, if Jumbo is sleepy, Jumbo must be either a baby elephant or a mammal. But if Jumbo is a living being, Jumbo cannot be both an elephant and a mammal (step 7).

Harkness Hall is booked in the evening, then it is not freely usable at night.\"  This implies that if Room 116 is booked in the evening, it cannot be freely usable at night.\n\nStep 4:  Analyze the premise \"If a classroom in William L. Harkness Hall is used for office hours, then it is booked in the evening.\"  If Room 116 is used for office hours (part of Category 1), then it will be booked in the evening.\n\nStep 5:  Combine the information from Steps 2, 3, and 4. If Room 116 is used for both lectures and office hours (Category 1), it will be booked during the day and in the evening, meaning it cannot be freely usable at night.\n\nStep 6:  Now consider the premise \"None of the classrooms in William L. Harkness Hall are private study spots.\" This eliminates private study spots as a possibility for Room 116.\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, if Room 116 is either both booked during the day and freely usable at night, or neither, it cannot be in Category 1 (used for both lectures and office hours).  The only remaining option is Category 2 (used for neither lectures nor office hours), which is impossible according to the premise \"All classrooms in William L. Harkness Hall are used for lectures or used for office hours.\"\n\nStep 8:  This contradiction means the conclusion is **False**.\n\n\n\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",
