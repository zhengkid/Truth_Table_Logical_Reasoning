The \"if\" part states: \"Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often\". The \"then\" part states: \"Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community\".\n\nStep 2:  We need to analyze if the \"if\" part can lead to the \"then\" part being true.  \n\nStep 3:  Examine the premises:\n\n* **Premise 1:** People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\n* **Premise 2:** People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\n* **Premise 3:** People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\n* **Premise 4:** All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n* **Premise 5:** All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n* **Premise 6:** Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nStep 4:  From Premise 6, we know Bonnie fits into one of two categories: \n    * Category 1: Bonnie attends school events often, is a student, and attends the school.\n    * Category 2: Bonnie does not attend school events often, is not a student, and does not attend the school.\n\nStep 5:  Now, let's see how these categories relate to the conclusion:\n\n* **If Bonnie chaperones high school dances:**  Premise 3 tells us chaperones are not students. This means Bonnie cannot be a young child or teenager wishing to further her academic career (Premise 5).  Therefore, if Bonnie chaperones, she cannot be both a young child/teenager and inactive/disinterested.\n\n* **If Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances:** This means she must be someone who attends school events often (Premise 6).  Premise 1 tells us that such people are not inactive and disinterested community members. Therefore, if Bonnie does not chaperone, she cannot be inactive/disinterested.\n\nStep 6:  Since neither scenario where Bonnie either chaperones or doesn't chaperone allows her to be both a young child/teenager and inactive/disinterested, the conclusion is false. \n\n\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

This means she is very conscious about her health and eating habits (Premise: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits).  But, she also disregards her physical well-being, which contradicts the premise that all people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.  Therefore, this category is impossible.\n\n    -  **Category 2:**  If Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious home nor disregards her physical well-being, it means she does not eat salads regularly (Premise: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits).  This also means she does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes (Premise: All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes).  Finally,  she does not visit the gym at least once a day (Premise: If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes).\n\n\nStep 3: Since the first category is impossible, the only remaining option is Category 2.
