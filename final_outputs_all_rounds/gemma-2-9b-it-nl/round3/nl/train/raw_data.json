If Jack is a high 3-point shooter, he must be solid at shooting 2-pointers.\n\nStep 6: The premise also states that no one on the team who is solid at shooting 2-pointers is bad at mid-range shots.  So, if Jack is solid at shooting 2-pointers, he cannot be bad at mid-range shots.\n\nStep 7: The conclusion states \"If Jack is not solid at shooting 2-pointers and bad at mid-range shots, then Jack is not solid at shooting 2-pointers and is a player who successfully shoots a high percentage of 3-pointers.\" This means if Jack is not solid at 2-pointers and bad at mid-range, he must be a high 3-point shooter.\n\nStep 8:  However, we already know from step 5 that if Jack is a high 3-point shooter, he must be solid at shooting 2-pointers. This contradicts the conclusion's statement that he is *not* solid at shooting 2-pointers.\n\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

The \"if\" part states: \"Hamlet has either won a Hugo Award and is written by Tolkien, or neither has won a Hugo Award nor is written by Tolkien\". The \"then\" part states: \"Hamlet has neither won a Hugo Award nor is written by Neil Gaiman\".\n\nStep 2:  We need to analyze if the \"if\" part can lead to the \"then\" part being true.  \n\nStep 3:  Consider the first part of the \"if\" statement: \"Hamlet has either won a Hugo Award and is written by Tolkien\".  This means Hamlet must meet BOTH conditions: win a Hugo Award AND be written by Tolkien.\n\nStep 4: We know from the premises that \"Some books that have won Hugo Awards are written by Neil Gaiman\". This does NOT mean ALL Hugo Award-winning books are written by Neil Gaiman. There could be Hugo Award-winning books written by other authors, including Tolkien.\n\nStep 5:  The second part of the \"if\" statement is \"neither has won a Hugo Award nor is written by Tolkien\". This means Hamlet cannot fulfill either of these conditions.\n\nStep 6:  Therefore, the \"if\" part of the conclusion is essentially saying Hamlet cannot be both a Hugo Award winner written by Tolkien AND not a Hugo Award winner nor written by Tolkien. This is a contradiction, and a contradiction in the \"if\" part automatically makes the entire conditional statement true. \n\nStep 7:  The conclusion, due to the inherent contradiction in its \"if\" part, is a vacuous truth. A vacuous truth is a statement that is always true because its hypothesis is always false. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",
