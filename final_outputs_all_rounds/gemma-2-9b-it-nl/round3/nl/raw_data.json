It says that if someone needs money for tuition, they don't need money for tuition. This is a logical inconsistency.\n\nStep 3: Because the premise about Hannah contains a logical contradiction, we cannot reliably determine whether she is or isn't a picky eater. \n\nStep 4:  Since we can't confirm if Hannah is not a picky eater, we also can't conclude for sure that she spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the dining halls.
