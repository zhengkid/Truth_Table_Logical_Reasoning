<truth_table>
Let:
    MR: Multivoxel analysis is mind‐reading.
    BR: Multivoxel analysis is brain reading.
    BD: Multivoxel analysis is brain decoding.
    E: Multivoxel analysis extracts information from BOLD signals.
    W: Multivoxel analysis is without statistical pattern analysis.
    N: Multivoxel analysis is writing a novel.

Premises:
    1. MR → (BR ∨ BD)
    2. (BD ∧ MR) → E
    3. (MR ∧ E) → ¬W
    4. N → W
    5. (W ∧ BR) → (W ∧ BD)
    6. MR is True

Logical chain:
    MR = True.
    From (1), BR ∨ BD = True.
    Case A: BD = True → by (2) E = True → by (3) W = False.
    Case B: BD = False, BR = True → if W were True then by (5) BD would be True, contradiction; so W = False.
    In all cases W = False.
    N is not determined by premises.
    Therefore W ∨ N = False ∨ unknown = unknown.

Truth Table (key rows):
| W     | N     | W ∨ N       |

Let:
    M: Multivoxel (pattern) analysis is mind‐reading. (Premise (6): M = True)
    B: It is brain reading.
    C: It is brain decoding.
    E: It extracts information from BOLD signals.
    S: It is without statistical pattern analysis.
    W: It is writing a novel.

Premises:
    (1) M → (B ∨ C)
    (2) (M ∧ C) → E
    (3) (M ∧ E) → ¬S
    (4) W → S
    (5) (S ∧ B) → (S ∧ C)
    (6) M = True

Conclusion to evaluate:
    W → (¬S ∧ ¬W)

We list key possible valuations of (W,B,C,E,S) consistent with M = True:

| W     | B     | C     | E     | S     | Premises hold? | W→(¬S∧¬W) |

| False | False | True  | True  | False | Yes            | True       |

In all valuations where the premises hold, the conclusion W→(¬S∧¬W) is True.

Let:
    P_A: Allison is at Luis's dinner party.
    D_A: Allison has room for dessert.
    B_A: Allison has room for broccoli.

Premises:
    1. For any person x, if x has room for dessert then x has room for broccoli. (D_x → B_x)
    2. Everyone at the dinner party has room for dessert. (P_x → D_x)
    3. Allison is attending the dinner party. (P_A = True)

From these premises:
    From (3) and (2): P_A = True → D_A = True.
    From D_A = True and (1): B_A = True.

Truth Table for Allison:
| P_A | D_A | B_A |

Let:
    P: The theistic God is a philosopher.
    R: The theistic God reasons.
    D: The theistic God can distinguish truth from falsehood.
    M: The theistic God is morally perfect.
    S: The theistic God is a sophist.

Premises:
    1. P → R
    2. R → D
    3. D → ¬M
    4. M = True

From (4) and (3): D must be False.
From D = False and (2): R must be False.
From R = False and (1): P must be False.

Thus the only freedom is S (True or False).

Let:
    C: Susan’s rent covers all utilities.
    W: Susan’s rent covers water.

Let:
    C: The fabric bundle is a piece of clothing.
    P: The fabric bundle is a product.
    D: The fabric bundle is a dress.
    R: The fabric bundle is perfect.

Premises:
    1. C → P
    2. P → ¬R
    3. D → C
    4. C → (R ∧ D)

Find all assignments where all premises hold:

Since C = True leads to contradiction (premise 4 vs. premise 2), C must be False.
With C = False, premise 1 and 4 are automatically true.
Premise 3 (D → C) then forces D = False.
Premise 2 (P → ¬R) allows two cases if P = False, one case if P = True:

| C | P | D | R | Premises True? |
|---|---|---|---|----------------|
| F | F | F | F | Yes            |
| F | F | F | T | Yes            |
| F | T | F | F | Yes            |
| F | T | F | T | No (P→¬R fails)|

In the three valid rows, R is not constant (both True and False occur).

Let:
    H: Charlie has Leo
    C: Charlie cares for Leo
    N: Leo is naughty
    L: Charlie likes Leo

Premises:
    1. H → C               (If someone has a pet, they care for it.)
    2. N → ¬L              (Naughty pets are not liked as much.)

Given:
    H = True              (Charlie has Leo.)
    N = True              (Leo is naughty.)

Logical evaluation:
    From H = True and (1): C = True.
    From N = True and (2): L = False.

Truth Table (for given values):
| H | N | C (H→C) | L (¬ if N) |
|---|---|---------|------------|
| T | T |    T    |     F      |

Conclusion ¬L ∧ ¬C:
    ¬L = True, ¬C = False, so ¬L ∧ ¬C = False.

Let:
    P: There exists a dog that is not naughty.  (i.e. Dogs are not always naughty)
    Q: There exists a dog that is naughty.
Premises:
    From “Charlie has a naughty pet dog named Leo,” we know Q = True.
Conclusion to evaluate:
    P.

Let:
    T: The Three-Body Problem was written by Cixin Liu.
    S: The Three-Body Problem has sold more than 1 million copies.
    F: The Three-Body Problem is about the future.

Premises:
    1. All books written by Cixin Liu have sold more than 1 million copies. (T → S)
    2. The Three-Body Problem has sold more than 1 million copies. (S = True)
    3. The Three-Body Problem is about the future. (F = True)
    (The other premises do not constrain T beyond (1).)

Truth Table (for T and S, given S = True and T → S must hold):
| T (Written by Cixin Liu) | S (Sold >1M) | T → S | S = True? | T → S? | Permitted? |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------|-----------|--------|------------|
| False (0)                | True (1)     | True  | Yes       | Yes    | Yes        |
| True  (1)                | True (1)     | True  | Yes       | Yes    | Yes        |

In both permitted cases the premises hold, but T can be either True or False.

Let:
    E: Elephantopus (the genus) is a traditional medicine.
    S: Elephantopus scaber (a species) is a traditional medicine.

Premises:
    S = True  (Elephantopus scaber is a traditional medicine)

No premise relates S → E.

Truth table:
| S     | E     | Remarks                               |
|-------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| True  | True  | Consistent with S = True               |
| True  | False | Also consistent with S = True          |

Since both E = True and E = False are possible when S = True, E cannot be determined.

<truth_table>
Let:
    O: Harkness is operated by Yale Housing staff.
    M: Harkness is managed by Yale Housing.
    D: Harkness is a dormitory.
    C: Harkness is located on the Yale campus.
    S: Harkness is open to students.
    B: Harkness was built before 1701.
    Y: Harkness is located on York Street.
    H: Harkness exists (we consider only cases where H = True).

Premises:
    1. D → C
    2. M → D
    3. O → M
    4. S → ¬B          (None open to students were built before 1701)
    5. C → S
    6. H ↔ (O ∨ Y)

Evaluate key cases for H = True:

| O | Y | M (3) | D (2) | C (1) | S (5) | B (4)  | H (O ∨ Y) |
|---|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| T | F | T     | T     | T     | T     | False  | T         |
| F | T | F     | F     | F     | ?     | ?      | T         |

Row 1: If O = True, then B = False.
Row 2: If Y = True and O = False, B is undetermined.

Thus B can be False or uncertain.

    M: The LaLaurie House is a mansion house.
    U: The LaLaurie House is in an urban area.
    S: The LaLaurie House is a skyscraper.
    C: The LaLaurie House is a creepy haunted house.
    T: The LaLaurie House is a terrifying building on Halloween.
Premises:
    (1) M → ¬U
    (2) S → U
    (3) C → M
    (4) T → C
    (5) C ∨ T
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    (¬M ∨ ¬U) → (S ∨ U)
We look for a case where premises are true but the conclusion is false. The conclusion is false exactly when ¬M ∨ ¬U is true and S ∨ U is false, i.e. U = 0, S = 0 (which makes S ∨ U = 0), and since U = 0, ¬U = 1 so ¬M ∨ ¬U = 1 regardless of M.

One such model:
    U = 0, S = 0, C = 1 (so by (3) M = 1), T = 0.
Check premises:
    (1) M=1 → ¬U=1 ✓
    (2) S=0 → U=0 ✓
    (3) C=1 → M=1 ✓
    (4) T=0 → C=1 ✓
    (5) C ∨ T = 1 ∨ 0 = 1 ✓
In this model the conclusion is false.

    4. T → C
    5. C ∨ T

Logical chain:
    From (5) and (4): if T then C; either way C = True.
    From (3): C = True → M = True.
    From (1): M = True → U = False.
    From (2): if S = True then U = True; but U = False, so S = False.
    Thus S = 0, M = 1, U = 0, C = 1, T ∈ {0,1}.

Truth Table (all rows satisfying premises):

Let:
    K: LaLaurie House is a skyscraper.
    U: LaLaurie House is in an urban area.
    M: LaLaurie House is a mansion house.
    C: LaLaurie House is a creepy haunted house.
    T: LaLaurie House is a terrifying building on Halloween.

Premises:
    1. U → ¬M
    2. K → U
    3. C → M
    4. T → C
    5. C ∨ T  (True)

Conclusion to Evaluate:
    (K ∨ C) → ¬M

Consider the following assignment consistent with premises:
    K = False
    C = True
    T = False
    From (3): C → M gives M = True
    From (2): K → U is vacuously true, U unconstrained here
    From (1): U → ¬M with M = True forces U = False
    From (4): T → C is vacuously true
    Premise (5): C ∨ T = True ∨ False = True

Evaluate Conclusion:
    K ∨ C = False ∨ True = True
    ¬M = False
    (K ∨ C) → ¬M = True → False = False

Thus the premises can be true while the conclusion is false.

    C: Phuoc Binh is classified as a nature reserve.
    E: There exists a nature reserve in Vietnam.

Premises:
    A = True.                                          (Phuoc Binh is a national park in Vietnam)

Let:
    N: Phuoc Binh is a national park in Vietnam.
    A: Phuoc Binh is managed by the Ministry of Agriculture.
    P: Phuoc Binh is managed by the People's Committee.
    U: Phuoc Binh is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Premises:
    (1) N = True.
    (2) ∀x [if x is a national park in Vietnam then x is a nature reserve] (irrelevant to U).
    (3) ∃x [x is a national park in Vietnam ∧ x is a UNESCO World Heritage Site].
    (4) ∀x [if x is a national park in Vietnam then (managed by MoA ∨ managed by PC)].
    (5) ¬A (Phuoc Binh is not managed by the Ministry of Agriculture).
From (1), (4), (5): P = True.
We do not know whether U holds for Phuoc Binh, since (3) only guarantees existence of some UNESCO park, not necessarily Phuoc Binh.

Let:
    X = “Coursing is a competitive sport.”
    Y = “Coursing involves spectators betting on a small game.”
    Z = “Coursing is banned.”

Premises imply:
    From “Coursing involves spectators betting on a hare…” and “Spectators betting on a hare is a small game” we get Y = True.
    From “If a competitive sport involves spectators betting on small games, then it is banned” we get (X ∧ Y) → Z.

We do not know X (whether coursing itself is a competitive sport). 

Truth table for the key cases:
| X     | Y     | (X ∧ Y) → Z | Z  | ¬Z (“No coursing is banned”) |
|-------|-------|-------------|----|-------------------------------|
| True  | True  | forces Z=1  | 1  | 0                             |
| False | True  | vacuously 1 | ?  | ?                             |

When X = True, Z = True so ¬Z = False.
When X = False, Z is not determined by the premises, so ¬Z is not determined.

Thus “No coursing is banned” is uncertain.

Let:
    L: x is a living thing
    T: x is a tree
    P: x is a plant
Premises:
    1. For all x, if T then P (T → P).
    2. There exists an x such that L ∧ T.
Logical chain:
    From (2), choose an x₀ with L = True and T = True.
    From (1) and T = True, we get P = True for x₀.
    Hence for x₀, L ∧ P is True.
Truth Table (for x₀):
| L (Living) | T (Tree) | P (Plant) | L ∧ P |
|------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| True       | True     | True      | True  |

Let:
    A: St Johnstone wins against Minsk.
    B: Minsk wins against St Johnstone.
Premises:
    1. A ∨ B           (either one team wins)
    2. ¬(A ∧ B)        (they cannot both win)
    3. B = True        (Minsk won)
Truth Table:
| A     | B     | A ∨ B | ¬(A ∧ B) |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| True  | True  | True  | False    |
| True  | False | True  | True     |
| False | True  | True  | True     |
| False | False | False | True     |
Valid rows must satisfy A ∨ B = True and ¬(A ∧ B) = True and B = True. That is only the row (A = False, B = True).
Therefore A = False: St Johnstone did not win.

Let:
    X: Minsk is part of the Scottish Premiership.
    Y: Minsk has joined the Scottish Premiership.
Premises:
    1. St Johnstone is part of the league (irrelevant to Minsk’s membership).
    2. If a team is part of the league, it has joined the league: X → Y.
    3. Minsk won against St Johnstone (no link to league membership).
    4. No premise about X being true or false.
Truth Table (for all cases satisfying premises):
| X (Minsk part) | Y (Minsk joined) | X → Y |
|----------------|------------------|-------|
| True           | True             | True  |
| False          | False            | True  |
Since both assignments satisfy all premises but yield different truth values for Y, Y is uncertain.

Let:
    B: Jake32 is a Boeing-737 plane.
    D: Jake32 is acquired by Delta in this batch.
    M: Jake32 has more than 300 seats.
    C: Jake32 has a capacity of 100 passengers.
    S: Jake32 is scheduled for a short-distance flight.
    P: Jake32 was produced before 2010.
Premises:
    1. B → ¬M
    2. D → B
    3. M ∨ C
    4. C → S
    5. C → P
    6. B ∨ D
From (1),(2),(6): if B∨D then ¬M.
With (3): ¬M → C.
Then (4),(5): C → S and C → P.
Thus in all cases satisfying premises, S = True and P = True.

    J_B: Jake32 is a Boeing-737 plane.
    J_D: Jake32 is acquired by Delta in this batch.
    J_M: Jake32 has more than 300 seats.
    J_C: Jake32 has capacity of 100 passengers.
    J_S: Jake32 is scheduled for a short-distance flight.
    J_P: Jake32 is produced before 2010.

Premises for Jake32:
    (1) J_B → ¬J_M
    (2) J_D → J_B
    (3) J_M ∨ J_C
    (4) J_C → J_S
    (5) J_C → J_P
    (6) J_B ∨ J_D

Logical deduction:
    From (6), the only valid assignments for (J_B, J_D) are (1,0) or (1,1).
    If J_B = 1, then by (1) J_M = 0 and by (3) J_C = 1.
    From J_C = 1, by (4) J_S = 1 and by (5) J_P = 1.
    In both valid cases, J_S = 1 and J_P = 1, so ¬J_S ∧ ¬J_P = 0.

Let:
    B: plane is a Boeing-737
    D: plane is acquired by Delta in this batch
    M: plane has more than 300 seats
    H: plane has capacity of 100 passengers
    S: plane is scheduled for a short-distance flight
    P: plane is produced before 2010
    For Jake32: J_B, J_D, J_M, J_H, J_S, J_P denote these properties.
Premises:
    1. B → ¬M
    2. D → B
    3. M ∨ H
    4. H → S
    5. H → P
    6. J_B ∨ J_D
Logical chain for Jake32:
    From (6) and (2): any J_D implies J_B, so in all cases J_B=1.
    Then by (1): J_M=0.
    Then by (3): J_H=1.
    Then by (4),(5): J_S=1 and J_P=1.
    Hence J_P ∨ J_S = 1 in every consistent case.
Truth Table (consistent cases for Jake32):

Let:
    P: Nadal is a professional tennis player.
    H: Nadal has a high win ratio.
    B: Nadal is a member of the Big 3.
    G: Nadal is the greatest player of all time.

Premises:
    P = True.
    H = True.
    B → (P ∧ H)      (All Big 3 players are professionals with high win ratios.)

We have no premise linking (P ∧ H) → B, nor any premise linking B to G.

Possible assignments consistent with premises (P and H must be True; implication holds for either B = True or B = False):

| B (Big 3) | P (Professional) | H (High Win Ratio) | B → (P ∧ H) | G (Greatest) |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|--------------|
| True      | True             | True               | True        | True or False|
| False     | True             | True               | True        | True or False|

Since G can be either True or False under these assignments, the conclusion G is not determined.

Let:
    S: "Oreos are sandwich cookies" (True)
    H: "Oreos are healthy"
    D: "Oreos are delicious"
Premises:
    1. No sandwich cookies are healthy: S → ¬H
    2. Oreos are sandwich cookies: S = True
Conclusion to evaluate:
    All sandwich cookies are delicious: S → D
Truth Table (considering S = True):

| True  | True  |  False | True  |
| True  | False |  False | False |
| False | True  |  True  | True  |
| False | False |  True  | False |
Premises require S→¬H = True and S = True, so H must be False.
This leaves two cases:
| H=False | D=True  | S→D = True  |
| H=False | D=False | S→D = False |
Since D can be either, the conclusion may be true or false.
Therefore, the statement is uncertain.

Let:
    H: Bailey is a human.
    F: Bailey is a flower.
    A: Bailey is an animal.
    P: Bailey is a plant.
    U: Bailey is a pupil.
Premises:
    A → ¬P
    H → A
    U → H
    F → P
    H ↔ F
Consistency check:
    H = F = 1 leads to A = 1 and P = 1, contradicting A → ¬P. 
    Thus H = F = 0. Then U → H forces U = 0. A and P may be:
Truth Table (consistent assignments):
| H | F | A | P | U |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
In every case U = 0.

Let:
    H: Bailey is a human
    A: Bailey is an animal
    F: Bailey is a flower
    P: Bailey is a plant
Premises:
    1. A → ¬P      (No animals are plants)

    3. F → P      (All flowers are plants)

| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | H=F=0, A=1 forces P=0      |
(Any assignment with H=F=1 is contradictory.)
In these models, P is sometimes 0, sometimes 1.

No assignment satisfies all premises without internal conflict; however, the only way to meet P1 and P2 is C = True, F = True. That forces V = True by P3. Thus in any non‐conflicting interpretation that respects donation and the “either/both” rule, V must be True.

Let:
    E: The watch is edible.
    C: The watch is a piece of clothing.
    F: The watch is food.
    W: The watch is wearable.
    S: The watch is a shoe.
    P: The watch is a slipper.

Premises:
1. Shoes are not food: S → ¬F.
2. All slippers are shoes: P → S.
3. Donated → (C ∨ F).  (The watch is donated, so C ∨ F must be True.)
4. Wearable things are not edible: W → ¬E.
5. All clothes are wearable: C → W.
6. ¬(E ∧ C) → [(E ∧ C) ∨ ¬(E ∨ C)] (enforces E ↔ C).

From (6): E = C.
From (5) & (4): C → ¬E, so if C = True then E = False, contradicting E = C, so C = False and hence E = False.
From (3): C ∨ F = True ⇒ F = True.
From (1): If S = True then ¬F, but F = True ⇒ S = False.
From (2): If P = True then S = True, but S = False ⇒ P = False.

The unique model satisfying all premises:
| C | E | F | W | S | P | ¬E ∧ ¬P |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|----------|
| F | F | T | F | F | F |   T      |

Let:
    O: Carlos Reyes is an Olympian.
    T: Carlos Reyes trains for an Olympic sport.
    G: Carlos Reyes goes to the Olympics.
    W: Carlos Reyes is a welterweight.
    H: Carlos Reyes is a heavyweight.

Premises:
    1. O ↔ (T ∧ G)                 (An Olympian trains and goes.)
    2. T = True                    (He trains.)
    3. G = True                    (He went.)
    4. W = True                    (He is welterweight.)
    5. H → ¬W                      (Heavy weights are not welterweights.)

Logical chain:
    From (2) and (3): T ∧ G = True.
    From (1): O = True.
    From (4) and (5): since W = True, H must be False.

Let:
    P: Carlos Reyes is an Olympian
    T: Carlos Reyes trains for an Olympic sport
    G: Carlos Reyes goes to the Olympics
    W: Carlos Reyes is a welterweight
    H: Carlos Reyes is a heavyweight
    M: Carlos Reyes won an Olympic medal

Premises:
    1. P ↔ (T ∧ G)         (definition of Olympian)
    2. T = True           (Carlos trains for an Olympic sport)
    3. G = True           (Carlos went to the Olympics)
    4. W = True           (Carlos is a welterweight)
    5. H → ¬W             (heavyweights are not welterweights)

From (4) and (5): W = True ⇒ H = False.

Conclusion to Evaluate: M (Carlos won an Olympic medal)

Possible assignments consistent with premises (T, G, W, H fixed):
| T    | G    | W    | H     | M    | Conclusion M |
|------|------|------|-------|------|--------------|
| True | True | True | False | True | True         |
| True | True | True | False | False| False        |

Both M = True and M = False are consistent with the premises; hence M is not determined.

Possible satisfying assignments include (among others):

| A | G | F | D | P | Remarks                                     |
|---|---|---|---|---|---------------------------------------------|
| F | F | F | F | T | A=F vacuously satisfies A→P and A→F.       |
| F | T | T | T | F | G→F forces F= T, then F→D gives D= T, D→¬P gives P=F. |

In some models G = F and in others G = T, so G is undetermined.

Let:
    A: Sam has high ambitions and future career goals.
    P: Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers.
Premises for Sam:
    If A then P.  (A → P)
We evaluate possible truth assignments consistent with the premise:

| A     | P     | A → P | Consistent? |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| True  | True  | True  | Yes         |
| True  | False | False | No          |
| False | True  | True  | Yes         |
| False | False | True  | Yes         |

Among the consistent cases, P can be True (row 1 and 3) or False (row 4). Therefore P is not determined.

Let:
    A: Sam has high ambitions and future career goals.
    F: Sam is a young teenage girl attending music festival frequently.
    P: Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers.
    M: Sam has a lot of music decorations in her room.

Premises:
    1. M → ¬E
    2. A → E
    3. P → M
    4. F → P
    5. A → P

From (1) and (2): A → ¬M.
From (5) and (3): A → P → M.
Together: A → M and A → ¬M ⇒ A must be False (A = F).
F can be either True or False under the premises.

Let:
    A: Sam has high ambitions and future career goals.
    F: Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers.
    D: Sam has a lot of music decorations in his room.
    P: Sam can pack and move out of his room very easily.
    G: Sam is a young teenage girl attending music festival frequently.
Premises:
    D → ¬P
    A → P
    F → D
    G → F
    A → F
Logical consistency analysis:
    Assume A = True:
        A → P gives P = True.
        A → F gives F = True.
        F → D gives D = True.
        D → ¬P gives ¬P = True, hence P = False.
        Contradiction (P is both True and False).
    Therefore A must be False for consistency.
Conclusion evaluation:
    If A = False, then A ∧ G = False regardless of G.
Truth Table (consistent cases):
| A     | G     | A ∧ G |

Let:
    H: Sam has high ambitions and future career goals.
    F: Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers.
    Y: Sam is a young teenage girl attending college.

Relevant premise:
    If Sam has high ambitions and future career goals, then Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers. (H → F)

Conclusion to evaluate:
    If Sam is a young teenage girl attending college, then Sam either does not have high ambitions and future career goals or is a big fan of pop bands and singers.
    This is Y → (¬H ∨ F).

We check that H → F logically entails Y → (¬H ∨ F). Truth table for H, F, Y under the constraint H → F:

| H | F | Y | ¬H ∨ F | Y → (¬H ∨ F) |
|---|---|---|---------|--------------|
| F | F | F |   True  |    True      |
| F | F | T |   True  |    True      |
| F | T | F |   True  |    True      |
| F | T | T |   True  |    True      |
| T | T | F |   True  |    True      |
| T | T | T |   True  |    True      |

(Note: H = True, F = False is ruled out by H → F.)

In every case consistent with H → F, Y → (¬H ∨ F) is True.

Let:
    A: Sam has high ambitions and future career goals.
    P: Sam can pack and move out of her room very easily.
    D: Sam has a lot of music decorations in her room.
    F: Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers.
    Y: Sam is a young teenage girl attending music festivals frequently.

Premises:
    1. D → ¬P
    2. A → P
    3. F → D
    4. Y → F
    5. A → F

From (5) and (3): A → D
From that and (1): A → ¬P
But from (2): A → P
So A → (P ∧ ¬P), hence ¬A must hold in any model satisfying the premises.

Thus A is forced False. For any value of Y, A ∧ Y = False, making the conditional (A ∧ Y) → (¬A ∨ ¬Y) vacuously True.

Truth Table (consistent with premises):
| A   | Y   | A ∧ Y | ¬A ∨ ¬Y | (A ∧ Y) → (¬A ∨ ¬Y) |

Let:
    A: Sam has high ambitions and future career goals.
    P: Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers.
    D: Sam has a lot of music decorations in his room.
    M: Sam can pack and move out of his room very easily.
    Y: Sam is a young teenage girl attending college.

Premises:
    1. D → ¬M
    2. A → M
    3. P → D
    4. F → P  (F: Sam attends music festivals frequently; not used in conclusion)
    5. A → P

Logical chain:
    From (5) and (3) and (1): A → P → D → ¬M
    From (2): A → M
    Hence A → M ∧ ¬M, a contradiction. Thus in any model satisfying the premises, A must be False.
    Therefore, for all models satisfying the premises, whenever A holds (which never happens) A → Y is vacuously True.

Let:
    C: Brita was a cargo ship built for Norwegians.
    I: Brita was impressed into service by Germany.
    S: Brita was seized by Germany.
    H: Brita was sold to Hong Kong.

Premises:
    C = True.
    I = True.
    I → S (Ships impressed into service were seized by whoever impressed them).
    H = True.

From I = True and I → S, we get S = True.

Conclusion to Evaluate:
    There was a cargo ship seized by Germany that was sold to Hong Kong, i.e., C ∧ S ∧ H.

Let:
    I: A ship has been impressed into service.
    S: A ship has been seized by whoever impressed it.
    H: A ship has been sold to Hong Kong.
Premises for the Brita:
    I → S
    For the Brita, I = True (impressed by Germany).
    Therefore S = True (seized by Germany).
    H = True (sold to Hong Kong).
We evaluate whether any seized ship has been sold to Hong Kong, i.e., S ∧ H for the Brita.

    IH: Brita was impressed into service by Hong Kong.
    SG: Germany seized the Britta.
    SH: Hong Kong seized the Britta.
Premises:

    For any X, if Brita was impressed into service by X, then X seized Brita. (Impressed_X → Seized_X)
    IH = False. (No premise that Hong Kong impressed Brita)

Let:
    F: Quincy can catch some footballs easily.
    G: Quincy is a good wide receiver.
    E: Quincy can catch every ball.

Premises:
    1. F = True (given).
    2. All footballs are balls.
    3. People who can catch balls are good wide receivers.
    4. Good wide receivers can catch with both their left and right hand.
    5. Good wide receivers play professionally.
    6. Quincy is professional (given).
Logical implications:
    From 1 and 2: Quincy can catch some balls.
    From 3: Quincy is a good wide receiver, so G = True.
    From 4: Quincy can catch with both hands, but this does not imply he can catch every ball.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    E (Quincy can catch every ball) is not determined by the premises.

Let:
    L: Longueau is served by regional TER Hauts-de-France trains.
    B: Boves is served by regional TER Hauts-de-France trains.
    R_X: Station X is on the Paris–Lille railway.
    P(X,Y): X precedes Y.
Premises (translated to Boolean or relational facts):
    1. B = True.  (Boves is served by TER Hauts-de-France)
    2. P(Longueau, Boves) = True.
    3. P(Boves, Dommartin) = True.
    4. R_Dommartin = True. (Dommartin is on the Paris–Lille railway)
    5. ∀X,Y [P(X,Y) → (R_X = R_Y)]. (Contiguous stations share the same railway)
    6. ∀X,Y,Z [P(X,Y) ∧ P(Y,Z) → P(X,Z)]. (Precedence is transitive)

From (2),(5),(4): P(Longueau, Boves) and P(Boves, Dommartin) and R_Dommartin = True
→ R_Boves = True and R_Longueau = True. 
Thus Longueau and Boves are on the Paris–Lille railway.

We know B = True. But no premise asserts that service by TER Hauts-de-France at Boves transfers to Longueau just because they share a railway. Therefore L is not determined.

Truth Table (key possibilities):
| B (Boves served) | L (Longueau served) | Remarks           |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| True             | True                | Possible scenario |
| True             | False               | Also possible     |

Since L can be either True or False given the premises, the conclusion L is uncertain.

Let:
    S: “Edwin Smith is a sergeant.”
    K: “Edwin Smith is from Auckland.”
Premises:
    S = True  (Edwin Smith was a sergeant)
    K = True  (Edwin Smith was from Auckland)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    No sergeants were from Auckland, i.e. ¬∃x (x is a sergeant ∧ x is from Auckland)
    Equivalent in this instance to ¬(S ∧ K)
Truth Table (for Edwin Smith):
| S (Sergeant) | K (From Auckland) | S ∧ K | ¬(S ∧ K) |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|----------|
| True         | True              | True  | False    |
Since S ∧ K is True, ¬(S ∧ K) is False, so the conclusion fails.

Let:

    H: x is a human
    T: x can turn into a wolf
    S: x has been scratched or bitten by another werewolf
    A: x has been attacked by that entity
    V: x is a wolf

Premises:
    1. W → (H ∧ T)        (a werewolf is a human that can turn into a wolf)
    2. W → S              (a werewolf has been scratched or bitten by another werewolf)
    3. S → A              (if scratched or bitten by some entity, then attacked by that entity)

Conclusion to Evaluate:
    W → V  (if x is a werewolf, then x is a wolf)

Since there is a case (row 1) where all premises hold but W→V is false, the conclusion is not entailed.

Let:
    B: A werewolf has been scratched or bitten by another werewolf.
    A: A werewolf has been attacked by another werewolf.
    S: A werewolf has scratched someone before.
Premises:
    1. B = True.
    2. B → A.
    3. No premise links A or B to S.
From (1) and (2): A = True.
But S can be either True or False independently.
Key possibilities:
| B   | A   | S   | B→A |

Premises:
    I = True.  (Jung was injured.)
    Injured people did not fight: I → ¬F.
Evaluate conclusion ¬F.
Truth table for I → ¬F:

Let:
    S: Lorca supported the Popular Front.
    O: Spanish Nationalists opposed Lorca.
    T: Lorca is a talented poet.
    L: Lorca is popular.
    K: Spanish Nationalists killed Lorca.

Premises:
    S = True.                                     (Lorca supported PF)
    S → O.                                       (SN opposed anyone supporting PF)

    (O ∧ L) → K.                                 (SN killed anyone they opposed and who was popular)

Evaluation:
    S = True → O = True.
    T = True → L = True.
    O ∧ L = True ∧ True = True → K = True.

Let:
    C: Damon drinks Coca-Cola or a Pepsi product every day.
    K: Damon drinks kombucha every day.
    G: Damon grew up with extremely busy parents who did not have time to pack lunch.
    E: Damon has erratic and diverse eating habits.
    R: Damon does not have consistent everyday routines and likes sticking to a solid schedule.
    V: Damon has to visit the dentist frequently.
    D: Damon is in Franny's family.
Premises:
    1. K ∨ C
    2. C → G
    3. C → V
    4. G → E
    5. E → R
    6. D = True
    7. G ↔ R
Conclusion to check:
    D ∧ V
Possible assignments satisfying all premises (with D = True always):
| C     | K     | G     | E     | R     | V     | Conclusion D ∧ V |

| False | True  | False | False | False | True  | True              |
| False | True  | False | False | False | False | False             |
(In all cases K ∨ C holds, G↔R holds, and other implications hold.)
Since in some models D ∧ V is true and in others false, the conclusion is uncertain.

Let:
    K: Damon drinks kombucha every day.
    C: Damon drinks Coca-Cola or a Pepsi product every day.
    B: Damon grew up with extremely busy parents who did not pack his lunch.
    D: Damon visits the dentist frequently.
    R: Damon has consistent everyday routines and likes sticking to a solid schedule.
Premises for Damon:
    1. K ∨ C
    2. C → B
    3. C → D
    4. B → E and E → ¬R combine with B ↔ R (either B∧R or ¬B∧¬R)  
       → From B → E and E → ¬R, B → ¬R; but R ↔ B, so B must be false.  
       → Hence B = 0, R = 0.
    5. From C → B and B = 0, we get C = 0.
    6. From 1 (K ∨ C) and C = 0, we get K = 1.
    7. D is unconstrained (free).
Evaluate the implication (Antecedent → Consequent), where
    Antecedent = (B ∧ K) ∨ (¬B ∧ ¬K)
    Consequent = ¬D ∧ ¬C

Possible assignments consistent with premises:
| B | K | C | D | Antecedent | ¬D ∧ ¬C | Implication |
|---|---|---|---|------------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0          | 1       | 1           |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0          | 0       | 1           |
In both cases the implication is true.

Let:
    D: Damon is in Franny's family. (D = True by premise)
    K: Damon drinks kombucha every day.
    C: Damon drinks Coca-Cola or a Pepsi product every day.
    G: Damon grew up with extremely busy parents who did not have time to pack lunch.
    E: Damon has erratic and diverse eating habits.
    R: Damon has consistent everyday routines and likes sticking to a solid schedule.
    B: Damon visits the dentist frequently.

Premises:
    1) K ∨ C.
    2) C → G.
    3) C → B.
    4) G → E.
    5) E → ¬R.
    6) D = True.
    7) (G ∧ R) ∨ (¬G ∧ ¬R)  (i.e. G ↔ R).

From (4), (5), and (7):
    G → E and E → ¬R and G ↔ R imply G = R = False.
From (1) and C → … contradictions if C = True, so C = False and hence K = True.

C = False ⇒ no constraint on B, so B may be True or False.

Evaluate the implication “If D ∧ (B ∨ K) then (B ∧ C)”:

Possible B values:

| B | D | K | C | B ∨ K | D ∧ (B ∨ K) | B ∧ C | Implication |
|---|---|---|---|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| F | T | T | F |   T   |      T      |   F   |     False   |

| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 ∨ 0 = 1        | 1    | 0    | No (M→¬H fails)    |

Valid assignments are (D=0, M=0, H=0) and (D=0, M=0, H=1). In one case H = 0, in the other H = 1.
Therefore H is uncertain.

Let:
    Cd: Arthritis is a cold
    M: Arthritis has mutations
    T: Arthritis can be treated at home
    Cc: Arthritis is colorectal cancer

Premises:
    1. All cancers have mutations: Cc → M
    2. No mutations can be treated at home: M → ¬T
    3. All colorectal cancers are cancers (combined with 1): Cc → M
    4. A cold can be treated at home: Cd → T
    5. Arthritis either is a cold and has mutations or neither is a cold nor has mutations: (Cd ∧ M) ∨ (¬Cd ∧ ¬M)

Evaluate possible cases for (Cd, M):
    Case1: Cd = T, M = T 
        → from (4): T = T
        → from (2): T = F 
        Contradiction, so discard.
    Case2: Cd = F, M = F 
        → satisfies (5)
        → from (1 & 3): Cc must be F (else M would be T)
        → T is unconstrained (could be T or F)

Remaining satisfying assignments:
| Cd | M  | T  | Cc |
|----|----|----|----|
| F  | F  | F  | F  |
| F  | F  | T  | F  |

In all valid cases, Cc = F.

Let:
    A: Arthritis is a cold.
    M: Arthritis has mutations.
    T: Arthritis can be treated at home.
    C: Arthritis is a cancer.
    R: Arthritis is a colorectal cancer.

Premises:
    1. All colorectal cancers are cancers: R → C
    2. All cancers have mutations: C → M
    3. No mutations can be treated at home: M → ¬T
    4. A cold can be treated at home: A → T
    5. Arthritis either is a cold and has mutations, or neither is a cold nor has mutations: (A ∧ M) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬M)

We enumerate the cases allowed by (5) and check consistency with (1)–(4):

Case 1: A = True, M = True
    From (4): A → T gives T = True
    From (3): M → ¬T gives T = False
    Contradiction, so Case 1 is invalid.

Case 2: A = False, M = False
    (4) and (3) place no constraint on T (A = False does not force T, M = False does not force ¬T).
    Consider C:
        If C = True then by (2) M = True, but M = False, so C = False.
    Consider R:
        If R = True then by (1) C = True, but C = False, so R = False.

Thus the only viable assignments are:
| A | M | T | C | R |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F | F |  *| F | F |

(* T may be either, does not affect R.)

In all valid cases, R = False.

Let:
    C: Arthritis is a cancer.
    M: Arthritis has mutations.
    T: Arthritis can be treated at home.
    O: Arthritis is a cold.
    R: Arthritis is a colorectal cancer.
Premises:
    1. C → M
    2. M → ¬T
    3. R → C
    4. O → T
    5. (O ∧ M) ∨ (¬O ∧ ¬M)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    R ∨ M
Logical Chain:
    From (5): O ↔ M.
    If M = True then O = True → by (4) T = True, but by (2) T = False, contradiction. Thus M = False and O = False.
    From M = False and (1): C = False.
    From C = False and (3): R = False.
    Therefore R = False and M = False, so R ∨ M = False.
Truth Table (for all models satisfying premises):
| O    | M    | C    | R    | T    | R ∨ M |

Premises:

Evaluate only assignments satisfying (5) and the implications:

Possible (D, M) to satisfy (5):
    D = 1, M = 1  → From 4: T=1; from 2: T=0 → contradiction.

Let:
    E: Arthritis is a colorectal cancer.
    C: Arthritis is a cancer.
    M: Arthritis has mutations.
    R: Arthritis is a cold.
    T: Arthritis can be treated at home.
Premises (for arthritis):
    1. C → M
    2. M → ¬T
    3. E → C
    4. R → T
    5. R ↔ M
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    ¬E → M
Logical Analysis:
    From (3) and (1) and (5) and (4) and (2), one finds E must be False, R must be False, hence M = False.
    T can be either False or True without violating the premises.
    In both consistent cases ¬E = True but M = False, so ¬E → M is False.
Truth Table (key possibilities):
| E     | R     | M     | T     | ¬E → M |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| False | False | False | False | False   |
| False | False | False | True  | False   |
(Note: E = True yields no assignment satisfying all premises.)

Let:
    I_Paolo: Paolo Roversi uses an Italian surname.
    P_Paolo: Paolo Roversi is a photographer.
Premises:
    Roversi is an Italian surname → any user of Roversi has I = True.
    Paolo Roversi uses Roversi → I_Paolo = True.
    Paolo Roversi is a photographer → P_Paolo = True.
Conclusion:
    "There are no photographers using an Italian surname" translates to: ∀x (P(x) → ¬I(x)).
Check for Paolo:
    P_Paolo = True
    I_Paolo = True
    P_Paolo → ¬I_Paolo = True → False = False
Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Let:
    V: Zaha Hadid was a visiting professor at Yale School of Architecture (True).
    P: Max plans to apply to the Yale School of Architecture (True).
    A: Max admires Zaha Hadid (the conclusion to evaluate).
Premises:
    V = True (given).
    P = True (given).
No premise connects P or V to A.
Thus A is not determined by the premises.

Let:
    I: fMRI is an invasive neuroimaging technique.
    NI: fMRI is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique.
    S: fMRI provides a spatial resolution of brains.
    M: fMRI is a measurement of brain activity.
    U: fMRI is used by neuroscience researchers.

Premises:
    1) I ∨ NI
    2) NI → S
    3) S → M
    4) M → U
    5) M ∨ NI

Conclusion to test:
    ¬(I ∧ U) → (¬NI ∧ ¬S)

Truth Table (only assignments satisfying premises):

| I     | NI    | S     | M     | U     | ¬(I∧U) | ¬NI∧¬S | Conditional |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|

| True  | False | True  | True  | True  | False  | False  | True        |
| True  | True  | True  | True  | True  | False  | False  | True        |
| False | True  | True  | True  | True  | True   | False  | False       |

In the last row, the antecedent is true but the consequent is false, so the conditional fails.

Let:
    P: James presents his work at the conference.
    T: James provides a tutorial session at the conference.
    A: James attends the conference in person.
    I: James is invited to join the club.
    S: James is provided with souvenirs.
    M: James is provided with delicious meals.
Premises:
    1) P ∨ T
    2) P → A
    3) T → I
    4) A → S
    5) I → M
    6) M → (happy to communicate)    (irrelevant to S)
    7) M → (invited to take photo)   (irrelevant to S)
    8) ¬(A ∧ S)
Logical analysis:
    Assume A = True → by (4) S = True → then A ∧ S = True, contradicting (8). 
    Thus A = False.
    Then from (2) P → A, P must be False.
    From (1) P ∨ T, T must be True.
    From (3) and (5), I = True and M = True (irrelevant to S).
    Since A = False, (4) is vacuously true, so S may be either False or True.
Possible assignments satisfying all premises:
| P | T | A | S |

Premises (must all be true):
    1. P ∨ T
    2. P → A
    3. T → I
    4. A → S
    5. I → D
    6. D → H
    7. D → F
    8. ¬(A ∧ S)

Construct truth table for all assignments satisfying 1–8:

<truth_table>
Let:
    P: James presents his work at the conference.
    T: James provides a tutorial session at the conference.
    I: James attends the conference in person.
    S: James is provided with souvenirs.
    C: James is invited to join the club.
    D: James is provided with delicious meals.
    M: James is happy to communicate with others during dinner.
    F: James is invited to take a photo with the audience.

Premises:
    1. P ∨ T
    2. P → I
    3. T → C
    4. I → S
    5. C → D
    6. D → M
    7. D → F
    8. ¬(I ∧ S)

Logical chain:
    Assume for contradiction I = True → by (4) S = True → contradicts (8). Thus I = False.
    From (2), I = False ⇒ P = False.
    From (1), P = False ⇒ T = True.
    From (3), T = True ⇒ C = True.
    From (5), C = True ⇒ D = True.
    From (6), D = True ⇒ M = True.
    From (7), D = True ⇒ F = True.

Truth Table (key row):
| P | T | I | S | C | D | M | F | F ∨ M |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--------|
| F | T | F | – | T | T | T | T |   T    |
(– indicates unconstrained)

Since F ∨ M is True, the conclusion holds.

Let:
    S: TS Leda has stabilizers.
    P: TS Leda has powerful steam turbine engines.
Premises:
    TS Leda was built with stabilizers → S = True.
    Stabilizers are found only on ships with powerful steam turbine engines → S → P.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    TS Leda had powerful steam turbine engines → P.
Truth Table (considering only assignments satisfying the premises S = True and S → P = True):
| S   | P   | S → P | Premises S=True and S→P=True | P (Conclusion) |
|-----|-----|-------|-------------------------------|----------------|
|  T  |  T  |   T   | satisfied                     | True           |
|  T  |  F  |   F   | not satisfied (violates S→P) | —              |
(All other rows violate S=True.)
Since the only assignment meeting the premises has P = True, the conclusion holds.

    N: TS Leda was a Norwegian vessel.
    B: TS Leda was built with stabilizers.
    E: TS Leda has a powerful steam turbine engine.

    There is no premise linking O to T.
Conclusion to Evaluate:

Let:
    H: Homesick is a play by Deborah Wallace.
    Y: Psyche is a play by Deborah Wallace.
    V: The Void is a play by Deborah Wallace.
    HB: Homesick is based on the life of James Miranda Barry.
    YB: Psyche is based on the life of James Miranda Barry.
    VB: The Void is based on the life of James Miranda Barry.

Premises:
    H = True     (Homesick is by Deborah Wallace)
    Y = True     (Psyche is by Deborah Wallace)
    V = True     (The Void is by Deborah Wallace)
    YB = True    (Psyche is based on Barry)

Conclusion to evaluate:
    No plays by Deborah Wallace are based on Barry, i.e., ∀P (D(P) → ¬B(P)).

Check Psyche:
    Y = True and YB = True
    → D(Y) → ¬B(Y) is False.

| The Void |  T   |  ?   |      ?       |

Since for Psyche the implication is false, the universal statement is false.

Let:
    C: Garry committed a crime.
    FG: Garry is found guilty.
    GI: Garry is truly innocent.
    GG: Garry is truly guilty.
    P: Garry is sentenced to punishment.
    A: Garry can argue against his punishment.

Premises:
    (1) GI → ¬GG.
    (2) ¬C → GI.
    (3) GG ∨ FG.
    (4) FG → P.
    (5) FG → A.
    (6) ¬FG ∨ P.

Conclusion to evaluate:
    ¬C ∧ A.

Consider two illustrative assignments consistent with all premises:

| FG | C  | GI | GG | P  | A  | ¬C ∧ A | Premises satisfied? |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|--------|---------------------|
| F  | T  | F  | T  | F* | F* |   F    | Yes                 |
| F  | F  | T  | F  | F* | T* |   T    | Yes                 |

(* P and A are unconstrained when FG = F; we choose values to illustrate both conclusion false and true.)
Since in one consistent case ¬C ∧ A is false, and in another it is true, the statement is uncertain.

Let:
    Gc: Garry is a convicted criminal (True).
    I: Garry is innocent.
    C: Garry committed a crime.
    Gty: Garry is truly guilty.
    Gf: Garry is found guilty.
    S: Garry is sentenced to punishment.
Premises (for Garry):
    1. Gc ∧ I → ¬Gty
    2. Gc ∧ ¬C → (truly innocent) — used to check consistency, but not needed in table.
    3. Gc → (Gty ∨ Gf)
    4. Gc ∧ Gf → S
    6. ¬Gf ∨ S
Conclusion:
    ¬(I ∧ ¬C)

Truth Table (key assignments showing both possible truth values of I ∧ ¬C while all premises hold):

| I | C | Gty | Gf | S | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P6 | I ∧ ¬C |
|---|---|-----|----|---|----|----|----|----|----|--------|
| 1 | 0 |  0  | 1  | 1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |   1    |
| 0 | 1 |  1  | 0  | 0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |   0    |
Explanation of rows:
- Row 1 (I=1, C=0): From P1 ⇒ Gty=0; P3 ⇒ Gf=1; P4 ⇒ S=1; P6 holds; thus I ∧ ¬C = 1.
- Row 2 (I=0, C=1): Choose Gty=1, Gf=0, S=0; all premises hold vacuously; thus I ∧ ¬C = 0.
Since the conclusion ¬(I ∧ ¬C) is 0 in row 1 and 1 in row 2, it is uncertain.

Let:
    FB: Phoenix is a French band.
    F: Phoenix has songs in French.
    E: Phoenix has songs in English.
    I: Phoenix’s music is classified as indie pop.
    P: Phoenix’s music is classified as pop rock.

Premises:
    1. I = True.
    2. FB = True.
    3. FB → (F ∨ E).
    4. ¬F = True.

From FB = True and ¬F = True:
    → E = True.

Classification (given “is classified under the indie pop genre”) is exclusive, so P = False.
