Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nA Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.\nAll games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.\nIf a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.\nThe Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBeijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China. \nBeijing is the capital city of the world's most populous nation.\nBeijing is located in Northern China.\nBeijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games.\nBeijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics.\nMany of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best universities in the world.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nBeijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nDiamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.\nRoderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.\nDiamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile.\nImperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nRoderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNo digital media are analog.\nEvery printed text is analog media.\nAll streaming services are digital media.\nIf an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.\nIf 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n1984 is printed text.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? 1984 is printed text.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nRobert Lewandowski is a striker.\nStrikers are soccer players.\nRobert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen.\nIf a player leaves a team they no longer play for that team.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nRobert Lewandowski is a soccer player.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBillings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.\nThe state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.\nWhite Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.\nThe city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.\nAny city in Butte is not in St Pierre.\nA city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nButte and St Pierre are in the same state.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nYale University is a private Ivy League research university.\nYale University moved to New Haven in 1716.\nYale university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.\nA list of residential colleges at Yale: Benjamin Franklin College, Berkeley College, Branford College, Davenport College, Ezra Stiles College, Grace Hopper College, Jonathan Edwards College, Morse College, Pauli Murray College, Pierson College, Saybrook College, Silliman College, Timothy Dwight College, and Trumbull College.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nYale University has the largest university endowment of any educational institution.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBadults is a British Sitcom series starring members of Pappy's.\nBadults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three.\nThe Working title \"The Secret Dude Society\" was used for Badults.\nAndrew Collins was the script editor for Badults.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nNo members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBooks contain tons of knowledge.\nWhen a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. \nIf a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.\nHarry read the book \u201cWalden\u201d by Henry Thoreau.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWalden contains knowledge.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nA natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.\nIf the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.\nMachine translation is a natural language processing task.\nThe output of machine translation is a text sequence.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nMachine translation is a language generation task.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome affection is love.\nSome love is positive.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nSome affection is positive.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome mammals have teeth.\nPlatypuses have no teeth.\nPlatypuses are mammals. \nHumans have teeth.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nPlatypuses are reptiles.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll hydrocarbons are organic compounds .\nAll alkanes are hydrocarbons\nAll organic compounds are chemical compounds.\nAll organic compounds contain carbon.\nNo chemical compounds contain only one element.\nThe mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe mixture is an alkane and contains carbon.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNone of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. \nAll of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. \nAll of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. \nAll of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. \nAll students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.\nJames is a student working in the lab. \nJames doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJames has a part-time job offered by the university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nA hawk never swims. \nSome birds are hawks.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nAll birds swim.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.\nIf a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.\nThe Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.\nAll shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.\nBreaking Bad is a show.\nBreaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. \nSevere cancers are deadly diseases.\nBile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. \nAll Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\nMild flu comes with a low survival rate.\nColorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nColorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nThe summer Olympic games is a sporting event. \nThe last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo.\nThe United States won the most medals in Tokyo. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe United States won the most medals in the last summer Olympic games.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNo one nice to animals is also mean to animals.\nSome grumpy people are mean to animals.\nAll animal lovers are nice to animals.\nAll pet owners love animals.\nTom is a pet owner.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
