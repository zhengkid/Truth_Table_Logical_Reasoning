This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that Rockie is a rabbit must be incorrect.\nStep 10: Since the initial inference that Rockie is a rabbit led to a contradiction, we must reconsider the initial inference that Rockie is a rabbit or a squirrel from Step 2. Given the contradiction in Step 9, the only remaining option is that Rockie is not a squirrel (already determined in Step 6) and therefore must be a turtle, as it cannot be a rabbit and the only other option is a turtle.\nStep 11: Given premise \"Some turtles can be spotted near the campus\" and the derivation that Rockie is a turtle (Step 10), we can conclude that Rockie is a turtle.\nStep 12: Given premise \"Rockie can be spotted near the campus and it is calm,\" and the derivation that Rockie is a turtle (Step 11), if Rockie were a turtle, it would not necessarily be calm (as the premises do not state that all or any turtles are calm), so we cannot confirm Rockie is a turtle based on the given premises, leading to uncertainty.\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

The information about Karen's behavior with Stranger Things does not transfer to her behavior with Black Mirror since we've established that the initial derivation of Karen binge-watching Stranger Things was incorrect due to the contradiction with the premise that Karen does not download Black Mirror.\nStep 6: We have no direct information from the premises that directly links the popularity of Stranger Things to Black Mirror or directly states the popularity of Black Mirror.

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

        "rationale": "Step 1: Given the premise \"Everyone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association,\" we can deduce that if Coco Gauff lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022, then Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.\nStep 2: From the premise \"If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis,\" we can conclude that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.\nStep 3: From the premise \"Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022,\" we know that Coco Gauff is either a male or female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Given the premise \"All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male,\" this covers all possible genders Coco Gauff could be.\nStep 4: From the premise \"If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022,\" we can infer that if Coco Gauff is a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, then Coco Gauff did not lose to Rafael Nadal. Since we know Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, this implies that if Coco Gauff is a male tennis player, then Coco Gauff did not lose to Rafael Nadal.\nStep 5: Given the premise \"All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal,\" if Coco Gauff is a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, then Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal. From Step 4, we know that if Coco Gauff is a male tennis player, then Coco Gauff did not lose to Rafael Nadal, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\nStep 6: Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 and cannot be a male tennis player, Coco Gauff must be a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. From the premise \"Everyone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association,\" we can conclude that Coco Gauff, being a female tennis player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022, is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.\nStep 7: From the premise \"If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis,\" we can deduce that Coco Gauff, being ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, is one of the most active players in major tennis.\nStep 8: The conclusion claims that Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis. We have established in Steps 1 and 2 that if Coco Gauff lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, then Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis, and we have established in Steps 6 and 7 that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis. Since we've established in Step 6 that Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association and lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, it directly contradicts the conclusion that Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

        "rationale": "Step 1: Given the premise \"International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa,\" we know that Mike, being an international student, must have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\nStep 2: The premise states that \"An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.\" This implies that if Mike has an F1 visa, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT to work in the US, but it does not say that he necessarily wants to work in the US.\nStep 3: We also know that \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" This implies that Mike wants to work in the US, as the condition for him applying for CPT is that he wants to work in the US.\nStep 4: From Steps 1 and 3, we know that Mike has either an F1 or J1 visa and wants to work in the US. Since he wants to work in the US, if he has an F1 visa, he would need to apply for CPT, which is mentioned in the premise. However, there is no information about J1 visa holders needing to apply for CPT or OPT to work in the US.\nStep 5: Given that Mike wants to work in the US and knowing the requirements for an F1 visa, it is possible that Mike could have a J1 visa, as there is no mention of J1 visa requirements for working in the US, so it's a viable option for him to work in the US without needing CPT or OPT.\nStep 6: Since the premises do not explicitly state that Mike has an F1 visa and only imply that he could potentially have a J1 visa to work in the US, we cannot confirm that Mike has an F1 visa, making the statement \"Mike has a J1 visa\" uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Therefore, it is impossible for Luke to have siblings who were born together.\nStep 11: Given the premise \"If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth,\" we can infer that if Luke has siblings who were born together, then Luke was born in a multiple birth, which we've established is impossible (Step 7). This means it is impossible for Luke to have siblings who were born together, and thus it is impossible for Luke to complain often about annoying siblings (Step 9).\nStep 12: Given the premise \"If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth\" and the derivation \"It is impossible for Luke to have siblings who were born together\" from Step 10, we can conclude that it is impossible for Luke to was born in a multiple birth (contradicting Step 7's conclusion that Luke is not born in a multiple birth), which is a contradiction. This indicates an error in the reasoning up to this point. \nStep 13: Re-evaluating the premises, we see that the conclusion that Luke is not born in a multiple birth (Step 7) was based on a contradiction with the premise \"Luke is either a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\" Since this conclusion was based on a contradiction, we must re-examine the premises to find an alternative explanation for whether Luke complains often about annoying siblings.\nStep 14: From the premise \"If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers,\" we know that if Luke lives at home, then he does not live with strangers. \nStep 15: From the premise \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home,\" we can infer that if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, then Luke lives at home.\nStep 16: From the premise \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings,\" we can infer that if Luke was born in a multiple birth, then Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\nStep 17: From Steps 15 and 16, we can conclude that if Luke was born in a multiple birth, then Luke lives at home and does not live with strangers.\nStep 18: Given the premise \"Luke is either a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers,\" we can see that the only way for Luke to not live with strangers is if he is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers, which we know is true (Step 7).\nStep 19: Since we know Luke is not born in a multiple birth (Step 7), we can infer that Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings (Step 1), and thus does not live at home (Step 4), which means Luke lives with strangers (Step 14).\nStep 20: Given that Luke lives with strangers (Step 19) and the premise \"If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together,\" we can infer that Luke complains often about annoying siblings, as it is the only remaining option that does not lead to a contradiction.\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

This contradiction means Peter cannot be the person who spills a lot of food on his clothing.\nStep 5: Since we've established that Peter cannot be the person who spills a lot of food on his clothing, we consider the other part of the disjunction in Step 3, which states that Peter is a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. If Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing, then he is not notably tidy (by the first premise), which means that the tidiness of Peter depends solely on his cleanliness.\nStep 6: Given that we've established in Step 4 that Peter cannot be the person who spills a lot of food on his clothing, we look at the cleanliness aspect of the disjunction. Since we cannot conclude that Peter is cleanly (because that would make him tidy, but we've established that not spilling food on clothing makes him not tidy), we cannot conclude that Peter is notably tidy.\nStep 7: Therefore, since we've established that being cleanly is what makes Peter tidy and we've ruled out the scenario where Peter is cleanly, we cannot confirm that Peter is notably tidy.\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

        "rationale": "Step 1: Given the premise \u201cIf people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy,\u201d and \u201cAll clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing,\u201d we can conclude that if Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, then he is not notably tidy.\nStep 2: Given the premise \u201cIf people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy,\u201d we can infer that if Peter is cleanly, then he is notably tidy.\nStep 3: From the premise \"Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly,\" we can see that Peter can either be someone who is cleanly (and thus tidy) or not cleanly (and thus not tidy).\nStep 4: Given the premise \"If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly,\" we can infer that if Peter values order and spotlessness, then he is cleanly.\nStep 5: From the premise \"All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness,\" we can deduce that if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter values order and spotlessness.\nStep 6: Combining the inferences from steps 1 and 4, if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter values order and spotlessness, and therefore is cleanly (by step 4), and thus tidy (by step 2), which contradicts the derivation from step 1 that if Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, he is not notably tidy. \nStep 7: From step 6, we know that if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, he cannot be a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try. This means that if Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, his family cannot prioritize order and spotlessness.\nStep 8: From step 3, we know Peter is either a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is cleanly, or he is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is not cleanly. From step 7, if he is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness. But from step 5, if his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness, then Peter does not value order and spotlessness, and thus is not cleanly (by step 4), and therefore not tidy (by step 2), which would make him not a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing (by step 1), contradicting the premise that he is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try. Therefore, it cannot be true that Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try.\nStep 9: From step 8, we conclude that Peter is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try. From step 3, if he is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, then he is not cleanly (because he must be the other option from the disjunction in step 3, not a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly). From step 2, if Peter is not cleanly, then he is not tidy. From step 1, if Peter is not tidy, then he does not spill a lot of food on his clothing. From step 5, if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter values order and spotlessness, and thus is cleanly (by step 4), and thus tidy (by step 2), which contradicts the derivation from step 8 that if Peter is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, he is not cleanly. This means that if Peter is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, his family must not prioritize order and spotlessness.\nStep 10: From step 9, we know that Peter is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, and from step 9, if he is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness. From step 5, if Peter's family does not prioritize order and spotlessness, then Peter does not value order and spotlessness, and thus is not cleanly (by step 4), and therefore not tidy (by step 2), which would make him not a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing (by step 1), contradicting the premise that he is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. Therefore, it cannot be that Peter is not a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.\nStep 11: From step 10, we conclude that Peter is a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly. From step 1, if Peter is a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing, then he is not tidy. From step 2, if Peter is not tidy, then he is not cleanly. This contradicts the derivation from step 11 that Peter is cleanly. Therefore, it cannot be that Peter is a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly.\nStep 12: From step 11, we know that Peter is not a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, so from step 3, he must be a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. From step 2, if Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing, then he is tidy. From step 2, if Peter is tidy, then he is cleanly. Therefore, Peter is a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly.\nStep 13: From step 12, we know Peter is a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, which means he is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try (by step 1), and his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness (by step 7), so he is neither a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

From Step 4, if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a single-seat electric car. But since we know Tesla Model 3 is not a one-seater and a one-seater is a single-seat electric car, it logically follows that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it is not a single-seat electric car.\nStep 6: Given premise \u201cIf something is a single-seat electric car, then it is a one-seater\u201d and derivation from Step 5 that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it is not a single-seat electric car, we can conclude that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it is not a single-seat electric car, which we already know is true, so we can infer that John's car is not a single-seat electric car.\nStep 7: From Step 6, we know that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it is not a Solo EV (since we can infer that it is not a single-seat electric car), so we have a derivation that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Solo EV.\nStep 8: Given premise \u201cIf John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car,\u201d we can derive that if John's car is not a Solo EV, it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. \nStep 9: From Step 7, we know that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it is not a Solo EV, so we can infer that if John's car is a Solo EV, it must be a single-seat electric car (because it cannot be a Tesla Model 3 and we know from Step 2 that all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters).\nStep 10: From Step 9, we know that if John's car is a Solo EV, it is a single-seat electric car, which means it is a one-seater. \nStep 11: From Step 1, we know that if something is a one-seater, it cannot transport multiple passengers. From Step 10, if John's car is a Solo EV, it is a one-seater, so it cannot transport multiple passengers.\nStep 12: Given premise \u201cIf something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters\u201d and derivation from Step 11 that if John's car is a Solo EV, it is a one-seater, we can conclude that if John's car is a Solo EV, it is not a multiple passenger vehicle.\nStep 13: From Step 7 and Step 12, we have two derivations: if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it is not a Solo EV, and if John's car is a Solo EV, it is a one-seater and cannot transport multiple passengers. These two derivations cover all possible scenarios for John's car being a Tesla Model 3 or a Solo EV, and in both cases, the conclusion is that it is not a multiple passenger vehicle.\nStep 14: From the premise \u201cJohn's car is not a multiple passenger vehicle\u201d and derivation that if John's car is a Solo EV, it is a one-seater and cannot transport multiple passengers, we can conclude that John's car is a Solo EV.\nStep 15: From Step 14, we know that John's car is a Solo EV, so we can conclude that the statement \"John's car is not a Solo EV\" is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

Since the premise also states \u201cRock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe,\u201d and we've established that if Rock is a monkey and flies, then Rock must be a bird and has wings, we can now consider the two options for Rock not being a monkey: if Rock is a bird, then Rock can fly (by premise), so if Rock is a bird, then Rock has wings; if Rock cannot breathe, then Rock does not fly (since if Rock cannot breathe, it cannot fly by the premise), so if Rock cannot breathe, then Rock does not have wings.\nStep 11: From the derivations in Steps 9 and 10, we can see that if Rock is a monkey, then Rock has wings, but if Rock is a bird, then Rock has wings, and if Rock cannot breathe, then Rock does not have wings. We know from Step 4 that if Rock is a monkey, then Rock can breathe, so we can rule out the scenario where Rock is a monkey and does not have wings.

        "rationale": "Step 1: Given premise \"All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged,\" we can conclude that if someone makes wedding plans, they are engaged.\nStep 2: Given premise \"All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans,\" we can conclude that if someone invites others to their ceremony, they are engaged.\nStep 3: Given premise \"Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony,\" we can conclude that if John has a well-attended wedding, then he invites others to his ceremony.\nStep 4: Given premise \"Some people who have well-attended weddings have larger families,\" we can conclude that if John has a well-attended wedding, then he has a larger family.\nStep 5: Given premise \"If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony,\" we can conclude that if John has a larger family, then he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony.\nStep 6: From Steps 3 and 5, we know that if John has a larger family, then he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony. From Step 4, we also know that if John has a larger family, then he has a well-attended wedding. Therefore, if John has a larger family, he has a well-attended wedding.\nStep 7: From Step 6, we know that if John has a larger family, then he has a well-attended wedding. From Step 1, we know that if John has a well-attended wedding, then he is engaged. Therefore, if John has a larger family, he is engaged.\nStep 8: Given premise \"If John is engaged, then he does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans,\" we can conclude that if John is engaged, he neither invites friends to his ceremony nor makes wedding plans.\nStep 9: From Step 7, we know that if John has a larger family, he is engaged. From Step 8, we also know that if John is engaged, he does not make wedding plans and does not invite friends to his ceremony. However, the premises do not say that John does not invite friends to his ceremony or make wedding plans under any other circumstances. Therefore, we cannot conclude that John does not invite friends to his ceremony or makes wedding plans in all cases, only that he doesn't if he is engaged.\nStep 10: Given premise \"All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans,\" we know that if John invites others to his ceremony, he makes wedding plans. From Step 8, we also know that if John is engaged, he does not make wedding plans and does not invite friends to his ceremony. From Step 2, we know that if John does not invite others to his ceremony, he is not engaged. Therefore, we cannot conclude that John is engaged based solely on the information that he does not invite friends to his ceremony and makes wedding plans, because it is possible for John to be engaged and not invite friends to his ceremony and make wedding plans.\nStep 11: From Step 7, we know that if John has a larger family, he is engaged. From Step 9, we know that if John is engaged, it is true that he does not invite friends to his ceremony and makes wedding plans, which means he does not invite friends to his ceremony and makes wedding plans. From Step 10, we know that if John does not invite friends to his ceremony, he is not engaged. Therefore, we have a contradiction that if John has a larger family, he is engaged, but also that if John is engaged, he does not invite friends to his ceremony and makes wedding plans, which means he does not invite friends to his ceremony and makes wedding plans, which in turn means he is not engaged. This is a contradiction, so the premise that John has a larger family cannot be true.\nStep 12: From Step 11, we know that if John has a larger family, he is engaged, but this leads to a contradiction, so we can conclude that John does not have a larger family.\nStep 13: From Step 12, we know that John does not have a larger family. From Step 6, we know that if John does not have a larger family, we cannot confirm that he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony. \nStep 14: From Step 13, we know that John does not have a larger family, and from Step 13, we also know that we cannot confirm that John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony. From Step 1, we know that if John has a well-attended wedding, he is engaged, but we cannot confirm that John has a well-attended wedding. From Step 2, we know that if John invites friends to his ceremony, he is engaged, but we cannot confirm that John invites friends to his ceremony. Therefore, we cannot confirm that John is engaged because we have two possibilities: he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony, but we cannot confirm either one.\nStep 15: Given the premises, we cannot confirm that John is engaged because we have two possible scenarios where John is not engaged (if he does not have a well-attended wedding and does not invite friends to his ceremony) and cannot confirm that he is engaged (if he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony).\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

        "rationale": "Step 1: The premise \"Space is a vacuum\" tells us that space is a vacuum.\nStep 2: The premise \"Vampires suck\" tells us that vampires are defined by their ability to suck.\nStep 3: The premise \"Plungers suck\" and \"A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck\" together imply that not all things that suck are household appliances, because plungers suck but a duster, which is a household appliance, does not suck.\nStep 4: From Step 3, we know that not all things that suck are household appliances, but we cannot conclude that a vacuum, which is what space is, is not a household appliance. The premise \"Space is a vacuum\" does not provide information about its classification as a household appliance.\nStep 5: From Step 2, we know that vampires suck, and from Step 1, we know that space is a vacuum. Therefore, if space is a vampire, then it would be something that sucks because vampires suck.\nStep 6: However, the premise \"A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck\" implies that not everything that sucks is a household appliance, but it does not imply that everything that is a household appliance sucks. It only provides information about dusters, not about vacuums or space.\nStep 7: From Step 4, we know that we cannot classify space as a household appliance, but that does not necessarily mean it cannot suck; we know from Step 5 that if space is a vampire, it would suck.\nStep 8: The premise \"Plungers suck\" tells us that there is something that sucks, and we've established in Step 7 that something that sucks is not necessarily a household appliance. This does not directly relate to the conclusion that space is a vampire, but it reinforces the idea that the category of \"sucks\" is not exclusive to household appliances.\nStep 9: From Step 5, we have a direct link between being a vacuum and sucking, and from Step 1, we know space is a vacuum. This directly connects space with the characteristic of sucking, which is what defines a vampire.\nStep 10: Given the information from Steps 1, 2, and 9, we can conclude that if space is a vacuum, it sucks, and sucking is the defining characteristic of a vampire, therefore space is a vampire.\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.\nIf a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.\nIf a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.\nAll family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.\nAll movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is a film.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series or both.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series or both.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n"

The premise \"Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs\" does not imply that aurochs do not exist, and there is no information about the current or past existence of aurochs.\nStep 5: The conclusion \"Aurochs are extinct\" cannot be definitively proven or disproven by the given premises. The premises do not provide any direct information about the current or past existence of aurochs, and the information about Heck cattle and the breeding process does not necessarily imply the extinction of aurochs.\nStep 6: Since there is no evidence to confirm or deny the existence of aurochs based on the given premises, the statement \"Aurochs are extinct\" remains uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

Therefore, if Breaking Bad gives out roses, then it is on Monday at 8 pm.\nStep 12: However, the premise does not state that Breaking Bad gives out roses, it only says \u201cIf roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm.\u201d We need to determine if Breaking Bad gives out roses to conclude the answer.\nStep 13: From Step 10, we know that if Breaking Bad gives out roses, then it is an episode of The Bachelor. But we know that \u201cBreaking Bad is not a reality TV show\u201d (Step 8), and we also know that \u201cThe Bachelor is a reality TV show\u201d (Step 4 and Step 6), so Breaking Bad cannot give out roses because if it did, it would be a reality TV show, which contradicts the given premise.\nStep 14: Since Breaking Bad cannot give out roses, the statement \u201cIf roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm\u201d is always false because the antecedent (roses are given out during Breaking Bad) can never be true.\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. \nSevere cancers are deadly diseases.\nBile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. \nAll Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\nMild flu comes with a low survival rate.\nColorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nColorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nAll people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\nAll people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\nAll people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nIf people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\nTaylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTaylor visits the gym at least once a day.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nThe summer Olympic games is a sporting event. \nThe last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo.\nThe United States won the most medals in Tokyo. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe world championships is a sporting event.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll horses have hooves.\nNo humans have hooves.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nSome humans are horses.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNo one nice to animals is also mean to animals.\nSome grumpy people are mean to animals.\nAll animal lovers are nice to animals.\nAll pet owners love animals.\nTom is a pet owner.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTom is a grumpy person.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

        "rationale": "Step 1: From the premise \u201cJane does not like any animals that bark\u201d and \u201cAll dogs are animals that bark,\u201d we can deduce that Jane does not like any dogs.\nStep 2: The premise states \u201cJane likes all animals that jump,\u201d and if an animal has legs, then it jumps (from the premise \u201cIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\u201d), so if Jane likes all animals with legs, she likes all animals that have legs.\nStep 3: From Step 1 and Step 2, we know that Jane has a contradictory attitude toward dogs: she does not like them because they bark, but she would like them because they have legs (since dogs have legs and legs imply jumping, which Jane likes). This is a contradiction, so our initial deduction that Jane does not like dogs must be incorrect. \nStep 4: Given the premise \u201cKiKi is an animal,\u201d and \u201cIf KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs,\u201d if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, it must be either terricolous or have legs. However, if KiKi has legs, then it jumps (from the premise \u201cIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\u201d), which contradicts the given that KiKi neither jumps nor has legs. Therefore, KiKi must be terricolous.\nStep 5: Since KiKi is terricolous (from Step 4), and given the premise \u201cIf an animal is terricolous, then it has legs,\u201d we can conclude that KiKi has legs.\nStep 6: Given that KiKi has legs (from Step 5), we know it jumps (from the premise \u201cIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\u201d), and given that Jane likes all animals that jump (from the premise \u201cJane likes all animals that jump.\u201d), we can deduce that Jane likes KiKi.\nStep 7: Given that KiKi is an animal that Jane likes (from Step 6) and that all dogs are animals that bark (from the premise \u201cAll dogs are animals that bark.\u201d), we can infer that if KiKi is a dog, it must be an exception to the initial premise that Jane does not like any animals that bark, which we already established is incorrect in Step 3. However, this does not necessarily mean KiKi is not a dog; it only means our initial deduction in Step 1 was incorrect. \nStep 8: From Step 7, we know that if KiKi is a dog, it would be an exception to the initial premise that Jane does not like any animals that bark. However, we cannot conclude that KiKi is a dog based on the information given in the premises. The premises do not provide a direct link between KiKi being terricolous and barking, and we cannot infer the barking behavior directly from the given premises. \nStep 9: Therefore, we cannot confirm that KiKi is a barking dog with the information provided, making the statement \u201cKiKi is a barking dog\u201d uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nAilton Silva played for Fluminense.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
