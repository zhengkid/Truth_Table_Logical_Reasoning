However, Step 2 and Step 3 suggest that if she doesn't perform in talent shows, she is an inactive and disinterested community member, which would make her a chaperone, and thus not a student (by Step 4). This would contradict Step 1, which implies that if she performs in talent shows, she attends and is engaged with school events, and thus must be a student. Therefore, Bonnie must perform in school talent shows often to be consistent.\nStep 6: Since we have determined that Bonnie must perform in school talent shows often to be consistent with the premises, the conclusion that \"Bonnie performs in school talent shows often\" is True.\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

        "rationale": "Step 1: Given the premise \"People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events,\" we can derive that if Bonnie is a person who performs in school talent shows, then she attends and is engaged with school events.\nStep 2: The premise also states that \"People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\" This means that if Bonnie is not performing in school talent shows, she is an inactive and disinterested community member.\nStep 3: From the premise \"All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances,\" we can conclude that if Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested community member, she chaperones high school dances.\nStep 4: The premise \"All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school\" tells us that if Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, she must be a student who attends the school.\nStep 5: Given the premise \"Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school,\" we can consider two scenarios for Bonnie: she either attends and is engaged with school events and is a student, or she does not attend and is not engaged with school events and is not a student.\nStep 6: If Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, from Step 4, we know she must be a student who attends the school. Given this, she must be someone who attends and is engaged with school events, as given in the first premise. Therefore, in this scenario, she is a student who attends the school.\nStep 7: If Bonnie is neither a young child nor a teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then she is an inactive and disinterested community member, as per the second premise. From Step 3, we know that an inactive and disinterested community member chaperones high school dances, so in this scenario, she chaperones high school dances.\nStep 8: Combining the conclusions from Steps 6 and 7, we find that in both possible scenarios for Bonnie, she is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

Since we already know \"The Legend of Zelda\" is made by a Japanese company, it satisfies this condition.\nStep 3: The premise \"If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list\" provides a condition for a game to be on the Top 10 list, which is selling more than one million copies.\nStep 4: Given \"The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies,\" we can deduce that \"The Legend of Zelda\" meets the condition to be included in the Top 10 list, as it sold more than one million copies.\nStep 5: Since we have established that \"The Legend of Zelda\" meets the criteria to be on the Top 10 list (being made by a Japanese company and selling over a million copies), it contradicts the conclusion that \"The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list.\"\nStep 6: A contradiction has been found, so we must reconsider our initial premises and conclusion.

However, the premise also states that \"Rockie can be spotted near the campus and is calm,\" which means Rockie cannot be a squirrel because squirrels are skittish and cannot be calm according to the given premises.\nStep 3: Given that \"The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels,\" and we have established that Rockie cannot be a squirrel, we can conclude that Rockie must be a rabbit.\nStep 4: Since we know that all rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute and Rockie can be spotted near the campus, we can conclude that Rockie is cute.\nStep 5: The premise states \"All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute,\" and we've established that Rockie is a rabbit and can be spotted near the campus, so Rockie is cute. \nStep 6: The premise also states \"Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.\" If Rockie is a rabbit, then it cannot be calm because all rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute, and if something is skittish, then it is not calm. Since we've established that Rockie is cute, it must be skittish, which means it cannot be a rabbit because rabbits are not skittish. This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that Rockie is a rabbit must be incorrect.\nStep 7: Given that the only other option for an animal that can be spotted near the campus is a squirrel, and we've established that Rockie cannot be a squirrel because it is calm, we must re-evaluate our previous steps. \nStep 8: From Step 2, we know that if Rockie is a squirrel, then it is skittish, which means it cannot be calm. However, the premise states that Rockie can be spotted near the campus and is calm, so Rockie cannot be a squirrel.\nStep 9: Since the only other option for an animal that can be spotted near the campus is a rabbit, and we've established that Rockie cannot be a squirrel or a rabbit, we have a contradiction. This means our initial assumption that Rockie can be spotted near the campus must be incorrect.\nStep 10: Given that the premises state \"Rockie can be spotted near the campus,\" and we've established that this assumption leads to a contradiction, we must re-evaluate our initial premises. \nStep 11: The premise \"Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm\" implies that Rockie is not a squirrel, as squirrels are skittish. We also know that Rockie is not a rabbit because it is calm. Given the premise \"The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels,\" we have a problem because we've established that Rockie cannot be either a rabbit or a squirrel.\nStep 12: Since we have a contradiction, we must look for an alternative explanation. The premise \"Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm\" implies that Rockie is not a squirrel, and we've established that Rockie is not a rabbit. The premise \"All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute,\" but it does not say that the only thing that can be spotted near the campus is a rabbit or a squirrel. It only says that the only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. It is possible that there is another animal that can be spotted near the campus, and Rockie is that animal.\nStep 13: Since we have established that Rockie is not a rabbit or a squirrel, and the premise \"The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels\" does not preclude the existence of other animals that can be spotted near the campus, we must consider the possibility that Rockie is neither a rabbit nor a squirrel.\nStep 14: Given the premise \"Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm,\" and that we've established that Rockie cannot be a rabbit or a squirrel, we cannot conclude that Rockie is a turtle because the premises do not provide information about turtles being able to be spotted near the campus. However, the conclusion that Rockie is not a turtle is not directly related to the information provided in the premises. The premises do not state that Rockie is a turtle, but they also do not provide any information that would conclusively prove that Rockie is a turtle. The conclusion that Rockie is not a turtle is based on the process of elimination, but the premises do not provide a clear answer to the question of whether Rockie is a turtle or not.\nStep 15: The premise \"Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm\" does not provide any information about Rockie's species, and the premises do not provide a clear classification of Rockie as a turtle, rabbit, or squirrel. The conclusion that Rockie is not a turtle is based on the process of elimination, but the premises do not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Rockie is a turtle or not.\nStep 16: The conclusion that Rockie is not a turtle is based on the fact that the premises do not provide any information that directly classifies Rockie as a turtle, and the process of elimination leads to a contradiction if we assume Rockie is a rabbit or a squirrel.

If Marvin is from Earth, then this conclusion would be false because Marvin would not be an extraterrestrial, hence not human. If Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars, this conclusion would be true because Marvin would not be from Mars, and since we established in Step 7 that if Marvin is not from Earth, he is an extraterrestrial, and since extraterrestrials are not human, Marvin would not be human. However, the premise \"Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars\" contradicts the premise \"Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither,\" so this scenario is not valid. Therefore, we only consider the first scenario where Marvin is from Earth, making the conclusion false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

We do not know if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, but we also do not know if she lost to Rafael Nadal. \nStep 5: Given that all male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal, if Coco Gauff is a male tennis player, then he would have lost to Rafael Nadal. However, we do not know if Coco Gauff is a male tennis player, so we cannot conclude that Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal based on this information.\nStep 6: Since we have two possible scenarios: Coco Gauff could be a female tennis player (in which case we have no information about her match against Rafael Nadal) or a male tennis player (in which case she would have lost to Rafael Nadal), we cannot definitively conclude that Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal.\nStep 7: Given the lack of concrete information about Coco Gauff's match against Rafael Nadal and the uncertainty about Coco Gauff's gender, we cannot confirm that the statement \"Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal\" is either true or false with the information provided.\nStep 8: Therefore, the conclusion that Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal is uncertain because we have two possible scenarios, one where she is a female and did not lose to Nadal, and one where she is a male and lost to Nadal, and we do not have enough information to determine which is the case.\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

This is because printed text is not analog, so if 1984 is a printed text, it cannot be analog.\nStep 5: Combining the inferences from steps 1 and 4, if 1984 is a hardcover book, then 1984 is not a digital media and also a streaming service, which is a contradiction since we know from step 1 that a streaming service is a digital media. Therefore, 1984 cannot be a hardcover book.\nStep 6: Since we have determined in step 5 that 1984 cannot be a hardcover book, and the premise \"If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book,\" we can conclude that 1984 is not a streaming service.\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

The premise \"The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents\" gives us two possibilities for the Hamden Plaza Subway store: it either has a rating greater than 4 or it is popular among local residents.\nStep 3: Given that \"Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews,\" we know that if the Hamden Plaza Subway store receives many negative reviews, it does not provide take-out service.\nStep 4: From Steps 1 and 2, we know that if the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than 4, it is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that the Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations and is a private company because the premises do not provide a clear classification of the Harvard Weekly Book Club as a business organization.\nStep 9: The premise \"All legal entities have legal obligations\" tells us that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity, it has legal obligations. From Step 1, we know that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a business organization, it is a legal entity. Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a business organization, it has legal obligations.\nStep 10: From Steps 6 and 9, we have two possible scenarios: the Harvard Weekly Book Club is either a business organization and has legal obligations, or it is not a business organization and does not have legal obligations. However, Step 7 shows that the Harvard Weekly Book Club cannot be both a business organization and a private company, so it must not be a business organization. Therefore, since it is not a business organization, it does not have legal obligations.\nStep 11: From Steps 10, we conclude that the statement \"The Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations and is a private company\" is false because the Harvard Weekly Book Club cannot be both a business organization and a private company, and if it is not a business organization, it does not have legal obligations.\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>",

From Step 4 and 5, we know that if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter is cleanly, which would make him tidy. Therefore, if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, he must be tidy.\nStep 7: Given the premise \"All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing,\" if Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, then he spills a lot of food on his clothing, which would make him not tidy (from Step 2).\nStep 8: From Step 6 and 7, we know that if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter is tidy, but if Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, then he is not tidy.

Since we've established that John cannot be engaged, it does not provide a reason to conclude that he has a larger family, so we cannot determine the size of his family.\nStep 8: Given the premises do not provide a direct information about John's family size when he is not engaged, and we've established in Step 6 that John cannot be engaged, we cannot conclude that John does not have a larger family with the information given.\nStep 9: However, the premise \"If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.\" If John has a larger family, he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony. But from Step 6, we know John cannot be engaged, and if he is not engaged, then he invites friends to his ceremony (from Step 5), so if John has a larger family, he must invite friends to his ceremony.\nStep 10: From Step 9, if John has a larger family, he invites friends to his ceremony, which means he is engaged (from Step 2 and Step 3), but we've established in Step 6 that John cannot be engaged, leading to a contradiction.

        "rationale": "Step 1: The premise states that \"Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.\" This implies that Heck cattle are a result of breeding back, which is a process of artificial selection to recreate an extinct species.\nStep 2: Given that \"Heck cattle are animals\" and \"Aurochs are animals,\" we can infer that Heck cattle and aurochs are both animals.\nStep 3: The premise \"Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals\" tells us that there is a category of animals that are bred back, and some of them resemble extinct animals. Since Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs, we can infer that aurochs are among the extinct animals that some animals bred back resemble.\nStep 4: Since Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs, and aurochs are among the extinct animals that some animals bred back resemble, we can conclude that aurochs are indeed extinct because they have already been used as a target for breeding back.\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

This is because if he likes music, he wants to compose, and if he wants to compose and has access to a program, he will compose.\nStep 5: The conclusion \"If George will not compose, George cannot compose\" is essentially saying that if George does not compose, then he cannot compose. This is a statement about the consequence of not composing.\nStep 6: Given the information from Step 4, we know that if George likes music, he will compose if he has access to a program. But this does not tell us anything about what happens if he does not compose.

It only tells us about Yuri's leg muscles' activity, not his ability to jump or his profession or nationality.\nStep 6: The conclusion \"If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player\" is the contrapositive of \"If Yuri is an American professional basketball player, then Yuri leaps straight into the air.\" We can derive this from Steps 1-4, as we know that if Yuri is a professional basketball player, he leaps straight into the air, and if he is an American professional basketball player, he is a professional basketball player. \nStep 7: However, we do not have direct information about Yuri's profession or nationality from the premises, and we cannot conclude that Yuri is an American professional basketball player from the given premises. Therefore, we cannot confirm the conclusion based on the information given.\nStep 8: Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the statement derived from the premises, and we cannot confirm the original statement \"If Yuri is an American professional basketball player, then Yuri leaps straight into the air\" with the given premises, we cannot confirm the conclusion.\nStep 9: The conclusion \"If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player\" is not directly proven or disproven by the given premises, making it uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

However, we do not know if KiKi jumps.\nStep 3: From the premise \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps,\" we can infer that if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps.\nStep 4: The premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs\" can be rearranged as \"If KiKi is not terricolous and does not have legs, then KiKi neither jumps nor has legs.\" Given that we do not know if KiKi is terricolous, we cannot conclude that KiKi is not terricolous, so we cannot use this premise to determine if KiKi has legs or jumps.\nStep 5: From Step 3, we know that if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps. Combining this with the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump,\" we can conclude that if KiKi has legs, Jane likes KiKi. However, from Step 1, we know Jane likes KiKi, so if KiKi has legs, Jane's liking KiKi is consistent. \nStep 6: Given the premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark\" and the conclusion \"KiKi does not bark,\" we can conclude that Jane's liking KiKi is consistent with KiKi not being a dog, as dogs are animals that bark.\nStep 7: From the premise \"All dogs are animals that bark,\" we can conclude that if KiKi is a dog, then KiKi barks, which contradicts the given fact that KiKi does not bark. Therefore, KiKi cannot be a dog.\nStep 8: From Step 7, we know KiKi is not a dog. From Step 6, we know that Jane's liking KiKi is consistent with KiKi not being a dog. From Step 1, we know Jane likes KiKi, and from the premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark,\" we can conclude that KiKi is not an animal that barks. From the premise \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs,\" we can infer that if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs. From Step 3, if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps, and from Step 2, if KiKi jumps, Jane likes KiKi, which is consistent with Jane's liking KiKi from Step 1. Therefore, we cannot conclude that KiKi is terricolous because it would lead to a contradiction with the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump\" as we cannot know for certain if KiKi jumps.\nStep 9: From Step 8, we know KiKi is not a dog and not terricolous. From the premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs,\" we can conclude that KiKi is terricolous or has legs. However, we cannot be certain about KiKi's status as terricolous or having legs because the premises do not provide a clear answer to this question.\nStep 10: From Step 9, we know KiKi is either terricolous or has legs. From Step 7, we know KiKi is not a dog, and from Step 6, we know that Jane's liking KiKi is consistent with KiKi not being a dog. From Step 1, we know Jane likes KiKi, and from the premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark,\" we can conclude that KiKi is not an animal that barks. From the premise \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs,\" we can infer that if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs, and from Step 3, if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps, and from Step 2, if KiKi jumps, Jane likes KiKi, which is consistent with Jane's liking KiKi from Step 1. Therefore, we cannot conclude that KiKi is terricolous because it would lead to a contradiction with the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump\" as we cannot know for certain if KiKi jumps.\nStep 11: From Step 10, we know KiKi is either terricolous or has legs, and we cannot conclude that KiKi is terricolous. From the premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs,\" we can conclude that if KiKi does not have legs, then KiKi is terricolous. However, we cannot determine if KiKi has legs or is terricolous, so we cannot be certain about KiKi's status as having legs or being terricolous.\nStep 12: From Step 11, we know we cannot conclude that KiKi has legs or is terricolous. From Step 7, we know KiKi is not a dog, and from Step 6, we know that Jane's liking KiKi is consistent with KiKi not being a dog. From Step 1, we know Jane likes KiKi, and from the premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark,\" we can conclude that KiKi is not an animal that barks. We also know that if KiKi neither has legs nor jumps, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs, but we cannot be certain about this status. \nStep 13: From Step 12, we know KiKi is not a dog, does not bark, and we cannot determine if it is terricolous or has legs. From the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump,\" we cannot conclude that Jane likes KiKi because we do not know if KiKi jumps. However, from Step 1, we know Jane likes KiKi, and from the premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark,\" we can conclude that KiKi is not a dog, which we already know from Step 7. \nStep 14: From Step 13, we know KiKi is not a dog and does not bark, and we cannot determine if it is terricolous or has legs. The premise \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps\" implies that if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps, and from Step 2, if KiKi jumps, Jane likes KiKi, which is consistent with Jane's liking KiKi from Step 1. Therefore, we cannot conclude that KiKi has legs because it would lead to a contradiction with the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump\" as we cannot know for certain if KiKi jumps.\nStep 15: From Step 14, we know KiKi is not a dog, does not bark, and we cannot determine if it is terricolous or has legs. From the premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs,\" we can conclude that KiKi is terricolous or has legs, but we cannot be certain about this status. \nStep 16: From Step 15, we know KiKi is not a dog, does not bark, and we cannot determine if it is terricolous or has legs. The premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark\" does not provide information about KiKi's status as terricolous or having legs, and the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump\" does not provide information about KiKi's barking or being a dog. The premise \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs\" does not provide information about KiKi's barking or being a dog.

The premise \"KiKi is an animal\" does not provide information about KiKi's barking or being a dog. We cannot conclude that KiKi is terricolous or has legs because the premises do not provide a clear answer to this question.\nStep 17: From Step 16, we know KiKi is not a dog, does not bark, and we cannot determine if it is terricolous or has legs. The premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark\" does not provide information about KiKi's status as terricolous or having legs, and the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump\" does not provide information about KiKi's barking or being a dog.

The premise \"KiKi is an animal\" does not provide information about KiKi's barking or being a dog. We cannot conclude that KiKi is a dog or barks because the premises do not provide a clear answer to this question.\nStep 18: From Step 17, we know KiKi is not a dog and does not bark, and we cannot determine if it is terricolous or has legs. The premise \"Jane does not like any animals that bark\" does not provide information about KiKi's status as terricolous or having legs, and the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump\" does not provide information about KiKi's barking or being a dog.
