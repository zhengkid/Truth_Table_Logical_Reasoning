Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n     - Notably, you mush define variables before using them.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     -

Imports:**\n   - The code starts by importing necessary functions from the `z3` library, including `Solver`, `DeclareSort`, `Function`, `ForAll`, `Exists`, `Implies`, `And`, `Not`, `Or`, `BoolSort`, and `Const`.\n\n**2. Defining the Domain:**\n   - `Person`: A sort representing individuals (tennis players).\n   - `Female`, `Male`: Predicates indicating whether a person is female or male.\n   - `Ranked_highly`, `Lost_to_Iga`, `Lost_to_Rafael`, `At_Roland_Garros`: Predicates representing the given attributes.\n\n**3. Constants:**\n   - `Iga_Swiatek`, `Coco_Gauff`, `Rafael_Nadal`: Constants representing the named individuals.\n\n**4. Solver Initialization:**\n   - A `Solver` object is created to handle the logical reasoning.\n\n**5. Encoding Premises:**\n   - Each premise is translated into a logical statement using Z3's functions and constants. \n   - For example, \"If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis\" is encoded as `ForAll([p], Implies(Ranked_highly(p), At_Roland_Garros(p)))`.\n\n**6. Defining the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion \"Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal\" is represented as `Lost_to_Rafael(Coco_Gauff, Rafael_Nadal)`.\n\n**7. Verification Process:**\n   - The code uses a two-step verification process:\n     - **Step 1:** `solver.add(Not(conclusion))`: It checks if the negation of the conclusion is satisfiable. If it's satisfiable (`result1 == \"sat\"`), it means the conclusion is not necessarily true.\n     - **Step 2:** `solver.add(conclusion)`: It checks if the conclusion itself is satisfiable. If it's satisfiable (`result2 == \"sat\"`), it means the conclusion is not necessarily false.\n\n**8. Result Interpretation:**\n   - Based on the results of the two checks, the code determines whether the conclusion is \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\".\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or would like to explore other logical reasoning examples!",

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n     - Notably, you mush define variables before using them.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n     -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n     - Notably, you mush define variables before using them.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n     - Notably, you mush define variables before using them.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     -

If it's not satisfiable, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n   - Then, the solver checks if the conclusion itself is satisfiable.\n\n5. **Result Interpretation:**\n   - Based on the solver's results, the code determines if the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logical reasoning problems you'd like to solve!",

For example, the premise \"If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy\" becomes `ForAll([p], Implies(Spills_a_lot(p), Not(Notably_tidy(p))))`.\n\n4. **Conclusion Encoding:**\n   - The conclusion is encoded as a logical expression: `Or(And(Clumsy_Foodie(Peter), Prioritizes_order_and_spotlessness(Peter)), And(Not(Clumsy_Foodie(Peter)), Not(Prioritizes_order_and_spotlessness(Peter))))`.\n\n5. **Verification Process:**\n   - We use `solver.push()` and `solver.pop()` to create a clean execution environment for each test.\n   - `solver.check(Not(conclusion))` checks if the negation of the conclusion is satisfiable.\n   - `solver.check(conclusion)` checks if the conclusion itself is satisfiable.\n   - The results are compared to determine the truth value of the conclusion.",

                "content": "You are an AI assistant that generates Python code for logical reasoning using the Z3 SMT solver. Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n     - Notably, you mush define variables before using them.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     - If an unexpected result occurs, print `\"Unexpected result, possible logical error.\"`\n\n3. **Output Formatting**\n    - The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const\n\n# Define the domain of discourse (entities)\nPerson = DeclareSort(\"Person\")\n\n# Define predicates\nSuperhero = Function(\"Superhero\", Person, BoolSort())\nCivilian = Function(\"Civilian\", Person, BoolSort())\nDestroyer = Function(\"Destroyer\", Person, BoolSort())\nGod = Function(\"God\", Person, BoolSort())\nWakes_up = Function(\"Wakes_up\", Person, BoolSort())\nAngry = Function(\"Angry\", Person, BoolSort())\nBreaks_bridge = Function(\"Breaks_bridge\", Person, BoolSort())\nHappy = Function(\"Happy\", Person, BoolSort())\nWears_uniform = Function(\"Wears_uniform\", Person, BoolSort())\n\n# Define constants\nPeter_Parker = Const(\"Peter_Parker\", Person)\nHulk = Const(\"Hulk\", Person)\nThor = Const(\"Thor\", Person)\n\n# Initialize solver\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Premises\nsolver.add(ForAll([Peter_Parker], Or(Superhero(Peter_Parker), Civilian(Peter_Parker))))  # Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian\nsolver.add(Destroyer(Hulk))  # The Hulk is a destroyer\nsolver.add(ForAll([Hulk], Implies(Angry(Hulk), Wakes_up(Hulk))))  # The Hulk wakes up when he is angry\nsolver.add(ForAll([Hulk], Implies(Wakes_up(Hulk), Breaks_bridge(Hulk))))  # If Hulk wakes up, he will break a bridge\nsolver.add(God(Thor))  # Thor is a god\nsolver.add(ForAll([Thor], Implies(Happy(Thor), Breaks_bridge(Thor))))  # Thor will break a bridge when he is happy\nsolver.add(ForAll([Thor], Implies(God(Thor), Not(Destroyer(Thor)))))  # A god is not a destroyer\nsolver.add(ForAll([Peter_Parker], Implies(Superhero(Peter_Parker), Wears_uniform(Peter_Parker))))  # Peter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero\nsolver.add(ForAll([Peter_Parker, Hulk], Implies(And(Destroyer(Hulk), Breaks_bridge(Hulk)), Not(Civilian(Peter_Parker)))))  # Peter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge\nsolver.add(ForAll([Thor, Hulk], Implies(Happy(Thor), Angry(Hulk))))  # If Thor is happy, then the Hulk is angry\n\n# Define the conclusion\nconclusion = Implies(Happy(Thor), Wears_uniform(Peter_Parker))\n\n# Check if the conclusion is necessarily true\nsolver.push()\nsolver.add(Not(conclusion))\nresult1 = str(solver.check())\nsolver.pop()\n\nsolver.push()\nsolver.add(conclusion)\nresult2 = str(solver.check())\nsolver.pop()\n\nif result1 == \"unsat\":\n    print(\"The conclusion is necessarily true: If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.

For example, `Named_after(Barutin_Cove, Barutin)` represents \"Barutin Cove is named after Barutin.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion is formulated as `Exists([c, b], And(Cove(c), Named_after(c, b), Located_in(b, Antarctica)))`. This translates to \"There exists a cove (c) and a Bulgarian settlement (b) such that c is named after b and b is located in Antarctica.\"\n\n6. **Verification Process:** We use the `solver.push()` and `solver.pop()` functions to isolate test conditions.\n\n7. **Result Interpretation:** The code interprets the solver's results (`\"unsat\"`, `\"sat\"`) to determine if the conclusion is necessarily true, false, or uncertain.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more logic problems to solve!",

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n     - Notably, you mush define variables before using them.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     -

Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   -

For example:\n     - `ForAll([p], Not(And(Nice_to_animals(p), Mean_to_animals(p))))` represents \"No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.\"\n\n4. **Formulate the Conclusion:**\n   - We define the conclusion as a logical expression using `Implies`: `Implies(Not(And(Grumpy(Tom), Mean_to_animals(Tom))), Not(And(Grumpy(Tom), Animal_lover(Tom))))`.\n\n5. **Verification Process:**\n   - We use the two-step verification process:\n     - First, we check if `Not(conclusion)` is satisfiable. If it is, the conclusion is not necessarily true.\n     - Second, we check if `conclusion` is satisfiable. If it is, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n   - We handle all possible results (`unsat`, `sat`, `error`) and print the appropriate message.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more logic problems you'd like to solve!",

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n     - Notably, you mush define variables before using them.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     -

Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n     - Notably, you mush define variables before using them.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     - If an unexpected result occurs, print `\"Unexpected result, possible logical error.\"`\n\n3. **Output Formatting**\n    - The Python Code should be enclosed within <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\nfrom z3 import Solver, DeclareSort, Function, ForAll, Exists, Implies, And, Not, Or, BoolSort, Const\n\n# Define the domain of discourse (entities)\nPerson = DeclareSort(\"Person\")\n\n# Define predicates\nSuperhero = Function(\"Superhero\", Person, BoolSort())\nCivilian = Function(\"Civilian\", Person, BoolSort())\nDestroyer = Function(\"Destroyer\", Person, BoolSort())\nGod = Function(\"God\", Person, BoolSort())\nWakes_up = Function(\"Wakes_up\", Person, BoolSort())\nAngry = Function(\"Angry\", Person, BoolSort())\nBreaks_bridge = Function(\"Breaks_bridge\", Person, BoolSort())\nHappy = Function(\"Happy\", Person, BoolSort())\nWears_uniform = Function(\"Wears_uniform\", Person, BoolSort())\n\n# Define constants\nPeter_Parker = Const(\"Peter_Parker\", Person)\nHulk = Const(\"Hulk\", Person)\nThor = Const(\"Thor\", Person)\n\n# Initialize solver\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Premises\nsolver.add(ForAll([Peter_Parker], Or(Superhero(Peter_Parker), Civilian(Peter_Parker))))  # Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian\nsolver.add(Destroyer(Hulk))  # The Hulk is a destroyer\nsolver.add(ForAll([Hulk], Implies(Angry(Hulk), Wakes_up(Hulk))))  # The Hulk wakes up when he is angry\nsolver.add(ForAll([Hulk], Implies(Wakes_up(Hulk), Breaks_bridge(Hulk))))  # If Hulk wakes up, he will break a bridge\nsolver.add(God(Thor))  # Thor is a god\nsolver.add(ForAll([Thor], Implies(Happy(Thor), Breaks_bridge(Thor))))  # Thor will break a bridge when he is happy\nsolver.add(ForAll([Thor], Implies(God(Thor), Not(Destroyer(Thor)))))  # A god is not a destroyer\nsolver.add(ForAll([Peter_Parker], Implies(Superhero(Peter_Parker), Wears_uniform(Peter_Parker))))  # Peter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero\nsolver.add(ForAll([Peter_Parker, Hulk], Implies(And(Destroyer(Hulk), Breaks_bridge(Hulk)), Not(Civilian(Peter_Parker)))))  # Peter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge\nsolver.add(ForAll([Thor, Hulk], Implies(Happy(Thor), Angry(Hulk))))  # If Thor is happy, then the Hulk is angry\n\n# Define the conclusion\nconclusion = Implies(Happy(Thor), Wears_uniform(Peter_Parker))\n\n# Check if the conclusion is necessarily true\nsolver.push()\nsolver.add(Not(conclusion))\nresult1 = str(solver.check())\nsolver.pop()\n\nsolver.push()\nsolver.add(conclusion)\nresult2 = str(solver.check())\nsolver.pop()\n\nif result1 == \"unsat\":\n    print(\"The conclusion is necessarily true: If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.
