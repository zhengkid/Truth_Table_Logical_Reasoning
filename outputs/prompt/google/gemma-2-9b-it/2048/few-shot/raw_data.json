Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     - If an unexpected result occurs, print `\"Unexpected result, possible logical error.\"`\n\n3. **Output Formatting**\n    -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     - If an unexpected result occurs, print `\"Unexpected result, possible logical error.\"`\n\n3. **Output Formatting**\n    -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     - If an unexpected result occurs, print `\"Unexpected result, possible logical error.\"`\n\n3. **Output Formatting**\n    -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   -

The comment in the code provides a placeholder for you to add these constraints.\n\n5. **Conclusion Encoding:**\n   - The conclusion \"St Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state\" is represented as `conclusion = IsIn(St_Pierre, Bismarck)`.\n\n6. **Verification Process:**\n   - The two-step verification process is implemented as in the previous examples.\n\n7. **Result Interpretation:**\n   - The code interprets the solver's results (`\"unsat\"`, `\"sat\"`) and prints the appropriate conclusion.",

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     - If an unexpected result occurs, print `\"Unexpected result, possible logical error.\"`\n\n3. **Output Formatting**\n    -

For example, the premise \"If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus\" is encoded as `ForAll([p], Implies(Order_takeout(p), Work_student_job(p)))`.\n\n3. **Formulating the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion is encoded as `And(Hannah == Mary_school, Or(Not(Picky_eater(Hannah)), And(Picky_eater(Hannah), Spend_time_dining(Hannah))))`.\n\n4. **Verification Process:**\n   - We use the `solver.push()` and `solver.pop()` commands to isolate the test conditions.\n   - `solver.add(Not(conclusion))` checks if the negation of the conclusion is satisfiable (meaning it's possible for the conclusion to be false).\n   - `solver.add(conclusion)` checks if the conclusion itself is satisfiable (meaning it's possible for the conclusion to be true).\n   - Based on the results of these checks, we categorize the conclusion as \"True\", \"False\", or \"Uncertain\".\n\n5. **Output:**\n   - The code prints the result and the corresponding category.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logic problems you'd like to solve using Z3!",

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     - If an unexpected result occurs, print `\"Unexpected result, possible logical error.\"`\n\n3. **Output Formatting**\n    -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     -

For example, `solver.add(Sucks(Plunger))` states that plungers suck.\n\n4. **Conclusion Encoding:**\n   - The conclusion `If something is a household appliance, it sucks.` is encoded as a universal quantifier: `ForAll([x], Implies(Household_Appliance(x), Sucks(x)))`.\n\n5. **Verification Process:**\n   - We use the two-step verification process as described in the guidelines:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n\n6. **Result Interpretation:**\n   - Based on the results of the solver (`str(solver.check())`), we categorize the conclusion as `True`, `False`, or `Uncertain` and print the corresponding message.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logical reasoning problems you'd like to solve!",

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     - If an unexpected result occurs, print `\"Unexpected result, possible logical error.\"`\n\n3. **Output Formatting**\n    -

Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   -

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, correctness, and clarity in the generated code:\n\n1. **General Structure**\n   - Use Z3's SMT solver to encode first-order logic (FOL) problems.\n   - Define sorts (types) for different entities in the domain.\n   - Define functions (predicates) to represent logical relationships.\n   - Declare constants for specific named entities.\n   - Add premises (assumptions) using logical constraints.\n   - Formulate the conclusion to be tested.\n   - Implement a two-step verification process:\n     - Check `Not(conclusion)` for counterexamples.\n     - Check `conclusion` for direct satisfaction.\n   - Categorize results into True, False, or Uncertain.\n\n2. **Code Formatting**\n   - **Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   -

For example, `Ailton Silva is a football player` becomes `FootballPlayer(Ailton_Silva)`.\n\n5. **Formulate the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion `Ailton Silva played for Fluminense` is represented as `PlaysFor(Ailton_Silva, Fluminense)`.\n\n6. **Verification Process:**\n   - We use `solver.push()` and `solver.pop()` to isolate test conditions.\n   - We check if `Not(conclusion)` is satisfiable (`result1`).\n   - We check if `conclusion` is satisfiable (`result2`).\n\n7. **Interpret Results:**\n   - Based on the solver's results, we determine if the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logical reasoning problems you'd like to solve!",

**Imports**: Always use `from z3 import ...` with explicitly imported functions.\n   - **Variable Naming**:\n     - Use **CamelCase** for sort names (e.g., `Person`, `School`).\n     - Use **snake_case** for function (predicate) names (e.g., `attended`, `located_in_UK`).\n     - Use **PascalCase** for constant entities (e.g., `William_Dickinson`, `Theistic_God`).\n     - Use **single-letter lowercase variables (`x`, `p`, `s`) for quantification**.\n   - **Logical Expressions**:\n     - Use `ForAll([...], Implies(...))` for universal constraints.\n     - Use `Exists([...], And(...))` for existential constraints.\n     - Use `Not(...)` to negate logical statements.\n   - **Solver Handling**:\n     - Always use `solver.push()` before adding a test condition.\n     - Always use `solver.pop()` after a test condition to restore the original state.\n     - Convert solver results to strings (`str(solver.check())`) for comparison.\n   - **Result Interpretation**:\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n     - If `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"unsat\"`, the conclusion is necessarily false.\n     - If both `solver.check(Not(conclusion)) == \"sat\"` and `solver.check(conclusion) == \"sat\"`, the conclusion depends on missing assumptions.\n     - If an unexpected result occurs, print `\"Unexpected result, possible logical error.\"`\n\n3. **Output Formatting**\n    -
