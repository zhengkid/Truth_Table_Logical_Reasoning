Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

If James is in other countries, he will work remotely from home (Step 5), so he will not have lunch in the company building (Step 3), but again we cannot be certain about his lunch location. Therefore, this statement is uncertain.\nStep 9: Next, let's analyze the second statement: \"If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.\" If James has lunch at home, he will work remotely from home (Step 4), and if he works remotely from home, he is in other countries (Step 5). In both cases, he will not be a manager (Step 6).

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\n\"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.\nIf a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.\nIf and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.\nKaren does not download \"Black Mirror.\"\n\"Black Mirror\" is a Netflix show.\nIf Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n\"Black Mirror\" is popular.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? \"Black Mirror\" is popular.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n\n\n"

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nEveryone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\nEvery Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.\nAll Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.\nAll professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.\nIf a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.\nIf a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous.\nAll well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.\nDjokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nDjokovic does not live in a tax haven.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nRobert Lewandowski is a striker.\nStrikers are soccer players.\nRobert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen.\nIf a player leaves a team they no longer play for that team.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nRobert Lewandowski is a soccer player.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.\nIf people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.\nPeople at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.\nIf people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.\nIf people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\nHannah is at Mary's school.\nHannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nHannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

Since we know from Step 3 that products from Baked by Melissa are not spicy, and it's also known that all mala hotpots are spicy (Step 5), this leaves the option that dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets as the only possible category for them to fit into to satisfy the \"or\" condition in the premise.\nStep 5: From the premise \"All mala hotpots are spicy,\" we know that if something is a mala hotpot, then it is spicy.\nStep 6: From the previous steps, we know that dried Thai chilies are either spicy, mala hotpots, or not baked sweets.

Given these premises, we can infer that dried Thai chilies must be either mala hotpots or not baked sweets, but we cannot determine with certainty that they are not products from Baked by Melissa because the premise \"Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets\" does not exclude them from being from Baked by Melissa.\nStep 7: Because we cannot determine with certainty that dried Thai chilies are not products from Baked by Melissa, the statement \"Dried Thai chilies are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets\" could potentially be false.\nStep 8: However, we also cannot confirm that dried Thai chilies are products from Baked by Melissa, as we only know they could be mala hotpots or not baked sweets, but there's no direct evidence they are from Baked by Melissa.\nStep 9: Therefore, given the premises, we cannot conclude with certainty that the statement is true or false.\nStep 10: Because there is a plausible scenario (being a mala hotpot) that doesn't involve being from Baked by Melissa, but we cannot confirm if the dried Thai chilies are indeed mala hotpots, the statement remains uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

However, this premise does not directly impact the ability to rent with a pet.\nStep 6: Given the premise \u201cIf a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet,\u201d we can infer that if The Olive Garden allows pets, then Tom would be allowed to move in with Fluffy.\nStep 7: The premise also states that \u201cIf he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500, then Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building.\u201d Since we know that The Olive Garden allows pets and the security deposit ($2000) is more than $1500, Tom would not meet the condition of the premise that the security deposit is no more than $1500.\nStep 8: Since the condition for Tom to rent an apartment in a managed building (i.e., the security deposit being no more than $1500) is not met, we cannot conclude with certainty that Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden.\nStep 9: There is no information in the premises that contradicts the possibility of Tom renting the apartment; it simply states that he cannot meet one of the conditions based on the given premises.\nStep 10: Therefore, the conclusion that Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden is uncertain because one of the necessary conditions for him to rent is not met.\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPets are allowed in some managed buildings.\nA deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.\nThe security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.\nFluffy is Tom's cat.\nCats are pets.\nThe Olive Garden is a managed building.\nThe monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.\n$2000 is more than $1500.\nTom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\nIf a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

However, this would imply that Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings (by the premise \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home\").\n\nStep 4: The conclusion from Step 3 leads to a contradiction with the conclusion from Step 2, indicating that Scenario 1 cannot be true. Therefore, we can eliminate this scenario.\n\nStep 5: Since Scenario 1 is eliminated, we are left with Scenario 2: Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. \n\nStep 6: Given that Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth, we can use the premise \"If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth\" to conclude that Luke does not have siblings who were born together. This implies that Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\nStep 7: Furthermore, given that Luke does not live with strangers (Scenario 2), we can use the premise \"If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers\" to conclude that Luke lives at home.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nThe Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas.\nJuan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.\nThe Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.\nThere are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJuan de Onate visited a mountain range in Texas.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

Therefore, we can conclude that John is not engaged.\nStep 3: The premise states that \"If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.\" From the premise in Step 1, we know that John does not invite others to his ceremony because he is not engaged. Therefore, if John has a larger family, he must have a well-attended wedding.\nStep 4: The premise states that \"Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.\" From Step 3, we know that if John has a larger family, then he has a well-attended wedding. Therefore, if John has a larger family, he must have a well-attended wedding. This implies that John has a well-attended wedding.\nStep 5: From Step 3 and Step 4, we know that John has a well-attended wedding because he has a larger family, and he has a well-attended wedding because he has a larger family. This is consistent, so we can conclude that John has a larger family and a well-attended wedding.\nStep 6: The premise states that \"Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.\" From Step 5, we know that John has a well-attended wedding, so we can conclude that John invites others to his ceremony.\nStep 7: From the premise \"All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans,\" we know that John makes wedding plans because he invites others to his ceremony.\nStep 8: From Step 2, we know that John is not engaged. From Step 7, we know that John makes wedding plans. Therefore, John makes wedding plans but is not engaged, which is a contradiction to the premise \"If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.\"\nStep 9: Because of the contradiction in Step 8, the conclusion \"John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding\" cannot be true, as it would require John to be not engaged and not make wedding plans, which is not the case.\nStep 10: However, we cannot conclude that John does invite others to his wedding and has a larger family because there is no direct premise that connects not being engaged to inviting others or having a larger family, only that if John is engaged, he doesn't invite others or make wedding plans. The premises do not provide a direct contradiction to the conclusion that John invites others to his wedding and has a larger family, only to the conclusion that he neither invites others nor has a larger family.\nStep 11: As a result, the statement \"John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding\" is uncertain because we have a contradiction with the premises but cannot conclude that it is false without directly contradicting the premises.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.\nIf a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.\nIf a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.\nAll family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.\nAll movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is a film.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series or both.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series or both.\n</Question> \n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\n\n\n"

This means that if Ekaterina has United States citizenship, then she can register to vote in the United States (from Step 2), and thus she is not a Russian federation official (from Step 5). But this contradicts the premise \"Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official\", so Ekaterina cannot have United States citizenship.\nStep 6: Since Ekaterina cannot have United States citizenship, and she has either United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship (from Step 3), we conclude that Ekaterina must have Taiwanese citizenship.\nStep 7: From the premise \"No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship,\" we know that Ekaterina is not a Russian federation official.\nStep 8: Given the premise \"Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom,\" we cannot conclude that Ekaterina is a manager at Gazprom. However, we also know that Ekaterina cannot have United States citizenship (from Step 5), and thus cannot participate in the 2024 United States presidential election (from Step 1), and Ekaterina is not a Russian federation official (from Step 7), so we cannot conclude that Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\nStep 9: However, the premise \"Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official\" tells us that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States if she is not a Russian federation official. Since Ekaterina is not a Russian federation official (from Step 7), we can conclude that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States.\nStep 10: From Step 1, since Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, we can conclude that Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\nStep 11: From the premise \"Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom,\" we cannot conclude that Ekaterina is a manager at Gazprom.\nStep 12: Given the premise \"Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official\" and Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States (from Step 9), we know that Ekaterina is not a Russian federation official.\nStep 13: Therefore, we can conclude that Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or is a manager at Gazprom because Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election (from Step 10) or Ekaterina is a Russian federation official (from Step 12).

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

        "rationale": "Step 1: From the premise \u201cAll hydrocarbons are organic compounds,\u201d we can conclude that if something is a hydrocarbon, then it is an organic compound.\nStep 2: The premise also states \u201cAll alkanes are hydrocarbons,\u201d which means if something is an alkane, then it is a hydrocarbon.\nStep 3: Combining these two steps, if something is an alkane, it is also an organic compound (by Step 2 and Step 1).\nStep 4: From the premise \u201cAll organic compounds contain carbon,\u201d we can deduce that if something is an organic compound, it contains carbon.\nStep 5: From the premise \u201cNo chemical compounds contain only one element,\u201d we can deduce that any mixture that contains only one element is not a chemical compound.\nStep 6: The premise also states \u201cThe mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither.\u201d This implies that if the mixture is a chemical compound, it must contain more than one element, and if it contains only one element, it is not a chemical compound.\nStep 7: From Step 5 and Step 6, we can conclude that if the mixture contains only one element, it is not a chemical compound.\nStep 8: Now, let's analyze the conclusion. The conclusion states that if the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then it is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane.\nStep 9: If the mixture contains only one element, it is not a chemical compound (by Step 7), so the conclusion is true for this case.\nStep 10: If the mixture contains carbon, it is an organic compound (by the premise \u201cAll organic compounds contain carbon\u201d) and, therefore, a hydrocarbon (by the premise \u201cAll hydrocarbons are organic compounds\u201d and the conclusion of Step 3), which makes it an alkane (by the premise \u201cAll alkanes are hydrocarbons\u201d and the conclusion of Step 3), but this contradicts the conclusion.\nStep 11: However, Step 10 reveals a contradiction with the premise that the mixture is an alkane when it contains carbon. This contradiction means that the premise \u201cAll alkanes are hydrocarbons\u201d or \u201cAll hydrocarbons are organic compounds\u201d cannot both be true when the mixture contains carbon.\nStep 12: However, we cannot conclude that the premise is false because it is given in the problem statement. This means that the mixture cannot be an alkane if it contains carbon.\nStep 13: Therefore, if the mixture contains carbon, it cannot be an alkane, but we cannot conclude that it is not a chemical compound. The premise \u201cThe mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither\u201d allows for the possibility that the mixture is a chemical compound even though it contains carbon.\nStep 14: Combining Steps 9 and 13, we can conclude that the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane if it contains only one element or contains carbon.\nTherefore, the answer is (A). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</Answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.\nIf a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.\nThe Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.\nAll shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.\nBreaking Bad is a show.\nBreaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nBreaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

If she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she eats salads regularly (by Step 2), and if she eats salads regularly, then she is very conscious about her health and eating habits (by Step 1).\nStep 6: However, the premise \u201cAll people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits\u201d implies that if Taylor disregards her physical well-being, then she is not very conscious about her health and eating habits. If she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she eats salads regularly (by Step 2), which would make her very conscious about her health and eating habits (by Step 1), but this contradicts the premise that she disregards her physical well-being.\nStep 7: Given the information from Steps 5 and 6, we can conclude that if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she cannot disregard her physical well-being, which would mean she must fulfill her daily nutritional intakes (by Step 3), and then visit the gym at least once a day (by Step 4).\nStep 8: Now, we also know that Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being (by the premise), so we have to consider the case where she did neither.\nStep 9: If Taylor did neither grow up in a health-conscious childhood home nor disregard her physical well-being, we cannot determine whether she visits the gym at least once a day from the given premises.\nStep 10: Because the premises do not provide enough information to determine whether Taylor visits the gym at least once a day when she did neither grow up in a health-conscious childhood home nor disregard her physical well-being, the conclusion is uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</Question>\n<Options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</Options>\n<Reasoning>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\nTherefore, the answer is (B). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<Premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nA podcast is not a novel.\nIf a person is born in American City, the person is American.\nIf a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer.\nDani Shapiro is an American writer.\nFamily History is written by Dani Shapiro.\nFamily History is a novel written in 2003.\nDani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets.\nBoston is an American city.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nDani Shapiro is a novel writer.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Since Jane does not like any animals that bark, we can infer that Jane does not like any animal that is a dog.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cJane likes all animals that jump\u201d tells us that if an animal jumps, Jane likes it. Since Jane likes animals that jump, and dogs do not jump (because they bark), we can infer that Jane likes KiKi if KiKi jumps.\nStep 4: The premise \u201cIf an animal has legs, then it jumps\u201d gives us a condition for an animal to jump: it must have legs. This implies that if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps, and Jane likes KiKi.\nStep 5: The premise \u201cIf an animal is terricolous, then it has legs\u201d tells us that if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs. Since KiKi has legs, KiKi jumps, and Jane likes KiKi (by Step 4), this contradicts the premise that Jane does not like any animals that bark (Step 1). Therefore, KiKi cannot be terricolous.\nStep 6: Since we have found a contradiction by assuming KiKi is terricolous, we can conclude that KiKi is not terricolous. We cannot conclude that KiKi is not terricolous because there is a possibility that KiKi is not terricolous and has legs, and Jane likes KiKi in this case.\nStep 7: The premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs\" tells us that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, KiKi is either terricolous or has legs. Since KiKi is not terricolous (Step 5), KiKi must have legs if it neither jumps nor has legs.\nStep 8: From Step 7, we can infer that KiKi has legs if it neither jumps nor has legs. Since KiKi has legs, KiKi jumps (Step 4), and Jane likes KiKi.\nStep 9: Therefore, we can conclude that KiKi is not terricolous and has legs, and Jane likes KiKi. But the question is about whether KiKi is terricolous. Since we cannot confirm this based on the premises, the answer is uncertain.\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n</Reasoning>\n<Answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</Answer>",
