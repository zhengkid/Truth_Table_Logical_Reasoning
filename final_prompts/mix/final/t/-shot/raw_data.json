People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\n2. People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\n3. People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\n4.

Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nWe need to determine if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Bonnie either performs in school talent shows often or is an inactive and disinterested community member.\n\nLet's assume Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested community member. According to premise 4, inactive and disinterested community members chaperone high school dances. According to premise 3, people who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school. However, this does not contradict Bonnie being a student who attends the school, as she could be a student who does not chaperone high school dances. But according to premise 5, all young children and teenagers in the club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. Since Bonnie is in the club, and we assumed she is a student who attends the school, she cannot be an inactive and disinterested community member.\n\nTherefore, Bonnie must perform in school talent shows often.\n\nThe statement \"Bonnie performs in school talent shows often\" is true.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... </code> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... </nl_cot> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... </truth_table> <answer> ... </answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.
