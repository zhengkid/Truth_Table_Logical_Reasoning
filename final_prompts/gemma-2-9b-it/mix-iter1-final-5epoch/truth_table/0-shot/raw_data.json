(\u00acT)\nConclusion to Evaluate:\n    Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm (M)\n\nLogical Chain:\n    From (6) we know \u00acT, and from (3) and (4) we know that if Breaking Bad were The Bachelor, it would be a reality TV show (T). Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot be The Bachelor (B).\n    From (2), if Breaking Bad gave out roses on TV (R), it would be an episode of The Bachelor (B), which we know it's not. Therefore, Breaking Bad does not give out roses on TV.\n    The first premise states that some show gives out roses on TV, but we can't conclude that it is Breaking Bad.\n    Since we cannot establish R as true for Breaking Bad, we cannot conclude M.\n\nTruth Table:\n\n| M (Breaking Bad on Monday at 8 pm) | R (Breaking Bad gives out roses on TV) | B (Breaking Bad is an episode of The Bachelor) | P (Breaking Bad portrays the lives of real people) | T (Breaking Bad is a reality TV show) |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| True  | True                         | True                                     | True                                       | True                                     |\n| True  | False                        | False                                    | False                                      | False                                    |\n| False | True                         | True                                     | True                                       | True                                     |\n| False | False                        | False                                    | False                                      | False                                    |\n\n\n\n</truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",
