Here's why:\n\n* **Premise 6** tells us about Bonnie's engagement and school attendance, but it doesn't directly link those to performing in talent shows. \n* **Premise 1** states that people who perform in talent shows are engaged and attend school, but it doesn't say that's the only way to be engaged and attend school.\n* There's no direct connection between Bonnie's characteristics and talent show performance.\n\n**Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.** \n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",
