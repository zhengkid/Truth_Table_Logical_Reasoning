This means if someone eats salads regularly, they must be very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nStep 3: Therefore, if Taylor disregards her physical well-being, she cannot eat salads regularly.\nStep 4:  The premise \"All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly\" states that everyone who grew up in a health-conscious environment eats salads regularly.\nStep 5:  We know \"All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes\". This means if someone fulfills their daily nutritional intake, they must have grown up in a health-conscious home.\nStep 6: We are given \"If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes\".
