She attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school.\n2. She is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nSince we know the first category implies she performs in talent shows often (Premise 1), and the second category doesn't tell us anything about talent shows, we can't definitively conclude whether Bonnie performs in talent shows often.\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>",

This means if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, she cannot be a female player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek (Premise 3).\n\nSince Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 (Premise 7), and all players there are either male or female (Premise 4), Coco Gauff must be either a male player who lost to Nadal or a female player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. \n\n* If she is a male player, she cannot lose to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek (Premise 3).\n* If she is a female player, she must have lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek (Premise 3).\n\nTherefore, Coco Gauff must be a female player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.  And as established earlier, this means she is also one of the most active players in major tennis.\n\n\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>",

Let's analyze the premises:\n\n* **Premise 3** tells us all streaming services are digital.\n* **Premise 1** tells us no digital media are analog.\n* **Premise 2** tells us all printed texts are analog.\n\nTherefore, if 1984 is a streaming service (Premise 3), it cannot be a printed text (Premise 1).  \n\n* **Premise 4** states that if something is a hardcover book, it is printed text. \n* **Premise 5** states that if 1984 is a streaming service, it is a hardcover book.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be a hardcover book (from Premise 1 and 2), but Premise 5 says it must be a hardcover book if it's a streaming service.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe premises create a contradiction, meaning the statement \"1984 is not a streaming service\" is **true**.\n\n\n</code>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",
