The premises are enclosed within <Premises> and </Premises>. The conclusion is specified within <Conclusion> and </Conclusion>. The question is enclosed within <Question> and </Question>, followed by the answer options in <Options> and </Options>. The reasoning section begins with <Reasoning> and ends with </Reasoning>. This section includes:\n1. Python Codes, enclosed in <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>. and 2. The answer based on the Python Codes. The final answer is enclosed within <Answer> and </Answer>.\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<Premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</Conclusion>\n<Question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
