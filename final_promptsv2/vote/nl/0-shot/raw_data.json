            "Step 1: From the premise \"All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek,\" and the premise \"Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022,\" we can deduce that if Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, then she lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\nStep 2: From the premise \"If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis,\" and the premise \"Everyone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association,\" we can deduce that if someone lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis.\nStep 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that if Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, then she is one of the most active players in major tennis.\nStep 4: The premise \"All male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal\" tells us that if Coco Gauff is a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, then she lost to Rafael Nadal.\nStep 5: The premise \"If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022\"  implies that if Coco Gauff is either ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, she cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\nStep 6:  We have a contradiction here. We know Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, and if she is a female player, she lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek and is one of the most active players. But if she is a male player, she lost to Nadal and cannot be ranked highly by the WTA. \nStep 7: Therefore, the statement \"Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis\" must be true.\n\n\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>",

            "Step 1: From the premise \"All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek,\" and \"Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022,\" we can infer that Coco Gauff is a female tennis player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022.\nStep 2: From the premise \"If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis,\" and the fact that Coco Gauff is a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 (from Step 1), and the premise \"Everyone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association,\" we can infer that Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.\nStep 3:  The premise \"If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022\" tells us that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly or lost to Nadal, she cannot be male. Since we know Coco Gauff lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek (Step 1), she is not male.\nStep 4: We have established that Coco Gauff is a female tennis player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek (Step 1) and is one of the most active players in major tennis (Step 2). \nStep 5: The conclusion states that Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.
