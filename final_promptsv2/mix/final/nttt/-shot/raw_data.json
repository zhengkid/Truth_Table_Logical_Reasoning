This statement is a disjunction (or) of two conditions, which means Bonnie can only fit into one of the two categories described.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications for Bonnie based on her status in the club.\n- If Bonnie is a very engaged and attending member, she must perform in school talent shows often (Premise 1).\n- If Bonnie is not a very engaged and attending member, she must be an inactive and disinterested community member (Premise 2). Inactive and disinterested members must chaperone high school dances (Premise 4), which means they cannot be students who attend the school (Premise 3).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given statement.\n- The statement claims that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n- Given the conditions and implications, if Bonnie is not a very engaged and attending member, she must be an inactive and disinterested member, which means she would be a chaperone and not a student, contradicting Premise 5. Therefore, Bonnie must be a very engaged and attending member.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the analysis.\n- Since Bonnie must be a very engaged and attending member, she performs in school talent shows often.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer><end_of_answer>",

However, if they were spicy, they would not be a baked sweet (from step 1), and therefore, they would not be a cupcake (from step 2). This conflicts with the fact that all products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes (from step 4), and we do not have any information that Dried Thai chilies are from Baked by Melissa.\nStep 7: If Dried Thai chilies were not baked sweets, they would not be cupcakes (from step 4), and thus, the statement \"All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes\" would not affect them. However, this still leaves us with the condition that they must be either spicy or a mala hotpot. Since Dried Thai chilies are spicy (from step 5), they cannot be a mala hotpot (because a mala hotpot would also be spicy, and we need to determine if they can be both).\nStep 8: Given the condition that Dried Thai chilies are spicy (from step 5) and no baked sweets can be spicy (from step 1), and all cupcakes are baked sweets (from step 2), Dried Thai chilies cannot be a cupcake. Therefore, Dried Thai chilies cannot be a mala hotpot either, as a mala hotpot must be spicy and not a baked sweet.\nStep 9: Since Dried Thai chilies are either spicy or a mala hotpot or not a baked sweet, and we have established they are not a mala hotpot and they are not a baked sweet, the only remaining possibility is that they are spicy.\nStep 10: The statement \"Dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot\" is false based on the given premises.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer><end_of_answer>",

Since people who are very conscious about their health and eating habits are those who eat salads regularly and those who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes, it follows that Taylor would either fulfill her daily nutritional intakes or not.\n\nStep 5: If Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, according to the inference from step 3, she visits the gym at least once a day. If Taylor does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes, then she must not have grown up in a health-conscious childhood home (since she did neither of the two options in step 4), and therefore, she is not very conscious about her health and eating habits. This would mean she does not eat salads regularly and does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes, which contradicts the fact that she did not grow up in a health-conscious home and still is not very conscious about her health and eating habits.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, Taylor must fulfill her daily nutritional intakes to avoid the contradiction, which means she visits the gym at least once a day.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer><end_of_answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

However, we do not know Jane's opinion on KiKi.\nStep 3: From \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps,\" we can infer that if KiKi jumps, it must have legs.\nStep 4: From \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs,\" we can infer that terricolous animals have legs.\nStep 5: The premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs\" can be broken down as follows: If KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, it must be either terricolous or have legs. This means that if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, it cannot be in a state where it does not have legs and is not terricolous.\nStep 6: Since KiKi is an animal, it either jumps or does not jump. If it jumps, it must have legs. If it does not jump, it must be terricolous or have legs, which means it cannot be in a state where it neither jumps nor has legs.\nStep 7: The conclusion we want to verify is \"KiKi is a barking dog.\" For KiKi to be a barking dog, it must be a dog and must bark.

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: given premises \"If Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\" and \"The Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up.\"\nStep 2: given premise \"If the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge.\"\nStep 3: given premise \"The Hulk is a destroyer.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge.\"\nStep 4: given premise \"Peter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian\"\nStep 5: given premise \"Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero.\"\nStep 6: given premise \"Peter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\" and derivation \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero.\", we can know \"If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform\"\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 1>\n\n<EXAMPLE 2>\n<premises>\nAll philosophers reason.\nSome sophists reason.\nAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood.\nNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is a sophist.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAilton Silva played for Fluminense.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
