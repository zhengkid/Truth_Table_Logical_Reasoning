This gives us two scenarios for Bonnie.\nStep 7: If Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, then based on the premises, she must perform in school talent shows often.\nStep 8: If Bonnie is not someone who attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school, then she must be an inactive and disinterested community member. According to the premises, inactive and disinterested community members are those who chaperone high school dances.\nStep 9: Given that chaperoning high school dances is associated with not being a student who attends the school and not performing in school talent shows often, we can rule out this scenario for Bonnie based on the given information.\nStep 10: Therefore, Bonnie must be in the scenario where she attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, which means she performs in school talent shows often.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer><end_of_answer>",

However, since we don't know if Coco Gauff is male or female, we cannot directly conclude she lost to Rafael Nadal based on this information alone.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022\" can be analyzed as follows:\n- If Coco Gauff is ranked highly, she is one of the most active players in major tennis, and she lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, which means she is a female player.\n- If Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, then she is not a male player.\n\nStep 5: From the premise \"If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022,\" and knowing that Coco Gauff is a female, the only way this statement holds true is if she did not lose to Rafael Nadal. If she did lose to Rafael Nadal, then she would not be a male player, which is consistent with her being female.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we can conclude that Coco Gauff has not lost to Rafael Nadal. If she had lost to Rafael Nadal, she would not be a male player, which would contradict her being a female player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer><end_of_answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

From Premise 1, if a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, it has not received many negative reviews. Therefore, the Hamden Plaza Subway store has not received many negative reviews.\n- From Premise 3, some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. Since the Hamden Plaza Subway store has not received many negative reviews, it cannot be one of those restaurants that do not provide take-out service.\n\nStep 5: Let's consider the second possibility:\n- If the Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents, then from Premise 4, it has a rating greater than four. This leads to the same situation as the first possibility: the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, it is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, and thus it has not received many negative reviews. Again, it cannot be one of those restaurants that do not provide take-out service.\n\nStep 6: In both scenarios, the Hamden Plaza Subway store cannot be a restaurant that does not provide take-out service.

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

(S \u2192 \u00acC)\n\nStep 3: From Premise 4 and Premise 5, we can infer:\n- If people value order and spotlessness (O), then they are cleanly (C).\n- All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness (F \u2192 O).\n- Therefore, if a family prioritizes order and spotlessness, the people in that family are cleanly (F \u2192 C).\n\nStep 4: From Premise 2 and Premise 6, we can analyze Peter's status:\n- Premise 2 states that clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\n- Premise 6 states that Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.\n- If Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing (S), then he cannot be cleanly (\u00acC) (from Step 2).\n- If Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing (\u00acS), then he must be not cleanly (\u00acC) (from Step 2).\n\nStep 5: Analyzing the conclusion:\n- Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.\n\nStep 6: From the premises, we know:\n- If Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently (C), then he spills a lot of food on his clothing (S) (Premise 2).\n- If Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness (F), then Peter values order and spotlessness (O) (Premise 5).\n- If Peter values order and spotlessness (O), then he is cleanly (C) (Premise 4).\n\nStep 7: Combining these, if Peter is a clumsy foodie (C) and his family prioritizes order and spotlessness (F), then he is both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently and is cleanly (C). This contradicts the premise that he cannot be cleanly if he spills a lot of food on his clothing (S).\n\nTherefore, Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie and his family prioritize order and spotlessness.

If John is engaged, he cannot both invite friends and make wedding plans.\n\nStep 6: Analyze the premise \"If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.\" This implies that if John has a larger family, he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends.\n\nStep 7: Let's derive the possible scenarios:\n- If John is engaged, he does not invite friends to his ceremony and make wedding plans (from premise 5).\n- If John has a larger family, he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends (from premise 6).\n- If John has a well-attended wedding (and he is engaged, from premise 1), he invites others to his ceremony (from premise 2).\n\nStep 8: Since John cannot be engaged and not invite friends or make wedding plans (premise 5), and he cannot have a larger family without either having a well-attended wedding or inviting friends (premise 6), we must examine if there's a contradiction or a way for John to be engaged without violating any premises.\n\nStep 9: If John is engaged, he does not make wedding plans and invite friends (premise 5), which means he cannot have a well-attended wedding (premise 3 and 4). Therefore, he cannot have a larger family (premise 6).\n\nStep 10: However, the premise \"If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans\" does not provide a direct contradiction to the possibility of John being engaged. The other premises do not directly contradict the possibility of John being engaged.\n\nStep 11: Given that the premises do not definitively state that John cannot be engaged, and there is no direct contradiction to the possibility of John being engaged, the statement \"John is engaged\" remains uncertain based on the given information.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer><end_of_answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

(\u00acB \u2192 \u00acE \u2228 \u00acD)\n- If George cannot compose (\u00acD), then he will not compose (\u00acE) or he does not want to compose (\u00acB). (\u00acD \u2192 \u00acE \u2228 \u00acB)\n\nStep 5: Given the contrapositive of the third premise, we know that if George will not compose (\u00acE), then he cannot compose (\u00acD) or he does not want to compose (\u00acB). However, we need to focus on the case where George will not compose (\u00acE) and see if it necessarily means he cannot compose (\u00acD).\n\nStep 6: If George will not compose (\u00acE), then from the contrapositive of the third premise, it must be true that (\u00acD \u2228 \u00acB). Since the statement we are evaluating is \"If George will not compose, George can not compose\" (\u00acE \u2192 \u00acD), we need to check if \u00acD is guaranteed.\n\nStep 7: From the contrapositive (\u00acD \u2192 \u00acE \u2228 \u00acB), if George will not compose (\u00acE), it is possible that he can still compose (\u00acD is not necessarily true). The contrapositive does not guarantee that if George will not compose, he cannot compose.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the statement \"If George will not compose, George can not compose\" (\u00acE \u2192 \u00acD) is not necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer><end_of_answer>",

This directly contradicts the fact that Tom, being a pet owner, is an animal lover and hence nice to animals.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer><end_of_answer>",

This means that having legs implies jumping.\n\nStep 3: From the premise \"All dogs are animals that bark,\" and \"Jane does not like any animals that bark,\" we can infer that Jane does not like any dogs.\n\nStep 4: Given \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs,\" we can infer that being terricolous means having legs.\n\nStep 5: To determine if KiKi is terricolous, let's consider the possibilities for KiKi:\n- If KiKi jumps, then KiKi must have legs (from the premise \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps\").\n- If KiKi does not jump, then KiKi must have legs (from the premise \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps,\" which is contrapositive of \"If an animal does not jump, then it does not have legs\").\n- If KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then KiKi must be terricolous or have legs (from the premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs\").\n\nStep 6: Since having legs implies jumping (from Step 2), and if KiKi does not jump, then KiKi must have legs. If KiKi does not have legs, then KiKi must be terricolous (from the premise \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs\").\n\nStep 7: Given that KiKi cannot be an animal that Jane does not like, and Jane does not like any animals that bark (which includes all dogs), KiKi cannot be a dog. However, this does not provide direct information about KiKi being terricolous.\n\nStep 8: The only way to be certain about KiKi being terricolous is if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, which would make KiKi either terricolous or have legs.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
