Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n"

From (6), (7), and (8), the Olive Garden is a managed building with a monthly rent of $2000. However, the security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent or more. Since $2000 is not more than $1500, it is impossible for the security deposit to be no more than $1500.\n6. Therefore, the condition for Tom to rent an apartment in a managed building (W and S) cannot be satisfied.\n\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| L (Managed building allows pets) | W (Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy) | S (Security deposit is no more than $1500) | T (Tom will rent an apartment) |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| True                             | True                                     | True                                     | True                         |\n| True                             | True                                     | False                                    | False                        |\n| True                             | False                                    | True                                     | False                        |\n| True                             | False                                    | False                                    | False                        |\n| False                            | True                                     | True                                     | False                        |\n| False                            | True                                     | False                                    | False                        |\n| False                            | False                                    | True                                     | False                        |\n| False                            | False                                    | False                                    | False                        |\n\n<end_of_truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer><end_of_answer>",

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n"

Therefore, if the mixture is a chemical compound (C), it cannot contain only one element (E).

Additionally, if the mixture is an alkane (A), it is a hydrocarbon (H), and from premise (1), it is an organic compound (O), and from premise (3), it is a chemical compound (C).

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n"
