        "rationale": "Step 1: Given the premise \"People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events,\" we understand that performing in school talent shows often is associated with attending and being very engaged with school events.\n\nStep 2: From the premise \"People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members,\" we know that performing in school talent shows often is exclusive to those who are not inactive and disinterested.\n\nStep 3: The premise \"People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school\" tells us that chaperoning high school dances is associated with not being a student who attends the school.\n\nStep 4: The premise \"All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances\" confirms that inactive and disinterested members of the community are those who chaperone high school dances.\n\nStep 5: The premise \"All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school\" suggests that those who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n\nStep 6: The premise \"Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school\" gives us two possibilities for Bonnie:\n   - Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school.\n   - Bonnie is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nStep 7: If Bonnie is a student who attends the school and is very engaged with school events, then according to step 1, she must perform in school talent shows often.\n\nStep 8: If Bonnie is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school, then she must be an inactive and disinterested community member. According to step 4, inactive and disinterested community members are those who chaperone high school dances. According to step 3, chaperoning high school dances is associated with not being a student who attends the school. Therefore, Bonnie would not perform in school talent shows often.\n\nStep 9: Since Bonnie is in the club and the two possibilities provided in step 6 cover all scenarios, we can conclude that either Bonnie performs in school talent shows often (if she is a student who attends the school and is very engaged with school events) or she does not perform in school talent shows often (if she is an inactive and disinterested community member who chaperones high school dances and is not a student who attends the school).\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer></answer>",

However, we need to check if it contradicts other premises.\n- The restaurant receives many negative reviews: This is directly stated in the conclusion and must be true for the conditions to be met.\n\nStep 4: From Premise 2, we know that all restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. And from Premise 1, if a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews. This creates a contradiction because if the Hamden Plaza Subway store receives many negative reviews, it cannot be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, and thus cannot have a rating greater than four.\n\nStep 5: Premise 5 states that the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. If it has a rating greater than four, then it must be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations (Premise 2) and cannot have received many negative reviews (Premise 1). However, if it is popular among local residents, then it has a rating greater than four (Premise 4).\n\nStep 6: Given the premises, if the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, it cannot have a rating greater than four. This is because receiving many negative reviews would disqualify it from being listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, and thus it cannot have a rating greater than four.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the conclusion is false because it claims that the restaurant has a rating greater than four, which contradicts the given premises.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer></answer>",

This means Luke must be in one of these two mutually exclusive scenarios.\n\nStep 7: If Luke is born in a multiple birth (and therefore has siblings who were born together), from the premise \"If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth,\" it follows that Luke has siblings who were born together. According to the premise \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings,\" Luke would spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\nStep 8: If Luke is not born in a multiple birth, he does not have siblings who were born together. From the premise \"If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together,\" we cannot conclude that Luke complains about siblings, as he does not have siblings who were born together. Since Luke does not have siblings who were born together, from the premise \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings,\" we cannot conclude that Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\nStep 9: Since Luke cannot be in the scenario where he is born in a multiple birth and live with strangers (as this would contradict the second part of the premise), and he cannot be in the scenario where he is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers (as this would also contradict the second part of the premise), we must consider the possibility that Luke is born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. In this case, from the premise \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings,\" Luke would spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\nStep 10: However, since Luke cannot be in the scenario where he is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers, and we have no information about Luke living at home or living with strangers, we cannot definitively conclude that Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer></answer>",

Therefore, we need to consider both scenarios:\n   - If Luke is born in a multiple birth, he cannot live with strangers.\n   - If Luke is not born in a multiple birth, he cannot live with strangers.\n\nStep 6: If Luke is born in a multiple birth, he cannot live with strangers, so he must live at home, and from the premise \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home,\" he would spend a lot of time with his siblings and often live at home.\n\nStep 7: If Luke is not born in a multiple birth, he cannot live with strangers, so he must live at home, and from the premise \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home,\" he would also spend a lot of time with his siblings and often live at home.\n\nStep 8: From the inference in Step 7, we know that Luke often spends time with his siblings and often lives at home. Therefore, from the premise \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home,\" we know that if Luke often spends time with his siblings, he often lives at home, which is consistent with the premises.\n\nStep 9: From the premise \"If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth,\" and from the fact that Luke often spends time with his siblings, we can infer that Luke has siblings who were born together, and from the premise \"If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together,\" we can infer that if Luke has siblings who were born together, he would complain often about annoying siblings.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer></answer>",

If he is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, he spills a lot of food on his clothing (Step 2). Therefore, if Peter is a clumsy foodie, he is not notably tidy.\nStep 8: If Peter is cleanly, he is notably tidy (Step 3). If Peter values order and spotlessness, he is cleanly (Step 4). If Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, Peter values order and spotlessness (Step 5). Therefore, if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, Peter is notably tidy.\nStep 9: Combining Steps 7 and 8, we see that if Peter is a clumsy foodie, he is not notably tidy, and if his family prioritizes order and spotlessness, he is notably tidy.

The fifth premise states that if people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

We need to determine if KiKi is a dog to evaluate if this part of the statement is true.\n\nStep 3: From the premise \"Jane likes all animals that jump,\" and \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps,\" we can infer that if an animal has legs, Jane likes it.

Since Jane likes animals that jump and have legs, and KiKi is not one of those, KiKi must not be terricolous (because if it were, it would have legs, which would make it likeable).\n\nStep 6: Since KiKi is not terricolous, it cannot have legs. And if KiKi does not have legs, it cannot jump. Therefore, KiKi is not one of the animals Jane likes.\n\nStep 7: From the premise \"All dogs are animals that bark,\" if KiKi were a dog, it would bark. Since KiKi does not have legs and does not jump, KiKi is not a dog. Therefore, KiKi does not bark.\n\nStep 8: From the conclusion \"KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog,\" both parts of the statement can be evaluated as true based on the premises.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer></answer>",

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that \u201cWilliam Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.\u201d We also know that \u201cThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,\u201d so we can confirm that William Dickinson\u2019s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
