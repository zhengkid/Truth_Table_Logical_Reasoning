This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says “The theistic God is a sophist.” We also know “Some sophists reason,” which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect—He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement “The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher” is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

 14%|█▍        | 1/7 [00:09<00:56,  9.35s/it]Step 1: We know from the premise "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school" that Bonnie fits one of two scenarios: 
    * Scenario 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school.
    * Scenario 2: Bonnie does NOT attend and is very engaged with school events AND is NOT a student who attends the school.

Step 2:  The premise "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school" tells us that if someone in the club chaperones dances, they cannot also be a student at the school.

Step 3: The premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances" tells us that if someone is inactive and disinterested, they will chaperone dances.

Step 4: The premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" tells us that if someone is a young child or teenager who wants to improve their education, they must be a student at the school.

Step 5: We need to analyze Bonnie's situation based on the two scenarios:

* **Scenario 1 (Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school):**  This scenario aligns with the premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school".  Since Bonnie is a student at the school, she wouldn't be inactive and disinterested, and therefore wouldn't chaperone dances. This scenario is consistent with Bonnie performing in school talent shows often because people who perform often attend and are engaged with school events.

* **Scenario 2 (Bonnie does NOT attend and is very engaged with school events AND is NOT a student who attends the school):** This scenario contradicts the premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" because Bonnie is not a student. This scenario also implies that Bonnie is inactive and disinterested, leading her to chaperone dances, which contradicts the premise "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school."

Step 6: Since Scenario 2 is impossible given the premises, we can conclude that Bonnie must fit Scenario 1.


Step 7: Because Scenario 1 is consistent with Bonnie performing in school talent shows often, we can conclude that the statement "Bonnie performs in school talent shows often" is **true**.

0 out of 1 is correct!
Step 1: Analyze Bonnie's situation: The premise states "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school." This tells us Bonnie fits one of two possibilities:
    * **Possibility 1:** Bonnie attends school events, is engaged, and is a student.
    * **Possibility 2:** Bonnie doesn't attend school events, isn't engaged, and isn't a student.

Step 2: Consider the conditional statement in the question: "If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community."

Step 3:  Break down the conditional statement:
    * **Hypothesis:** Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities.
    * **Conclusion:** Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

Step 4: Analyze the relationship between Bonnie's possibilities and the conditional statement's hypothesis:
    * **Possibility 1 (Bonnie attends school events, is engaged, and is a student):**  This possibility doesn't directly tell us if Bonnie is a young child/teenager wishing to further her education or a chaperone.  Therefore, we can't definitively say if the hypothesis holds true for this possibility.
    * **Possibility 2 (Bonnie doesn't attend school events, isn't engaged, and isn't a student):** This possibility aligns with the premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances."  

Step 5: Conclusion: Since we cannot definitively say whether the hypothesis holds true for Possibility 1, and Possibility 2 aligns with the hypothesis, the conditional statement is not guaranteed to be true in all cases.  We lack sufficient information to determine with certainty if Bonnie fits the conditions of the hypothesis.

The final answer is (C).
</answer>
0 out of 2 is correct!
Step 1: Analyze Bonnie's situation: We know Bonnie is in the club and fits one of two scenarios: either she attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student, or she does NOT attend and is not very engaged AND is not a student.

Step 2: Consider the implications of the "if-then" statement in the conclusion: It says "If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community."

Step 3:  We need to break down this "if-then" statement into its parts.

Step 4: The first part is "Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often." This means Bonnie fits into one of these two scenarios:
    *  Scenario A: Bonnie chaperones high school dances.
    *  Scenario B: Bonnie does NOT chaperone high school dances AND performs in school talent shows often.

Step 5: Now, let's analyze the second part: "then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community."

Step 6: We need to see if either scenario (A or B) leads to this conclusion being true.

Step 7: Let's analyze Scenario A: "Bonnie chaperones high school dances."  We know from the premises that "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school."  Also, "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances." Therefore, if Bonnie chaperones, she is NOT a student and IS inactive and disinterested. 

Step 8:  However, the conclusion also states that Bonnie must be a "young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities." This information is NOT guaranteed if she chaperones.  We don't know if all chaperones fit this description.

Step 9: Now, let's analyze Scenario B: "Bonnie does NOT chaperone high school dances AND performs in school talent shows often." We know from the premises that "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events."  This means if Bonnie performs often, she attends and is engaged with school events.

Step 10: We also know from Bonnie's situation that she is either a student who attends and is engaged OR not. If she performs often, she must be the former. Therefore, if Bonnie performs often, she IS a student.

Step 11: However, the conclusion also states that Bonnie must be "an inactive and disinterested member of the community." This contradicts our finding that she performs often and is engaged, as the premises state "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events."

Step 12: Since neither scenario definitively leads to the conclusion being true, the statement "If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community" is uncertain.

Step 1: From the premise "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager," we can deduce that if James is in the company today, he must be a manager. Conversely, if James is a manager, he will be in the company today.

Step 2: The premise "No managers work remotely from home" tells us that if James is a manager, he cannot be working remotely from home.

Step 3: We know that "Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home." and "If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home."  This means that if James has lunch at home, he is working remotely from home.

Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we see that if James is a manager, he cannot have lunch at home.

Step 5: Since James is either a manager or not, and if he is a manager he cannot have lunch at home, the only remaining option is that James must have lunch in the company building.

0 out of 4 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager."
Step 2: We also know that "No managers work remotely from home."
Step 3: From premises "If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home" and "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home," we can infer that employees who have lunch at home are either in other countries or working remotely from home.
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that if James is a manager, he cannot have lunch at home.
Step 5: Since James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager, and managers cannot have lunch at home, James must not have lunch at home.
Step 6: We also know that "Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers" and "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today."
Step 7:  Therefore, if James does have lunch in the company building, he must be a manager, which contradicts our previous deduction that managers cannot have lunch at home.
Step 8:  This means James cannot have lunch in the company building.

<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
0 out of 5 is correct!
Step 1:  Let's break down the complex conclusion into smaller, more manageable parts. The statement essentially says: 

* **Part 1:** If James is a manager or in other countries, he doesn't have lunch at home and doesn't work remotely.
* **Part 2:** If James has lunch at home or works remotely, he's neither a manager nor in other countries.

Step 2:  We can analyze each part separately using the given premises:

* **Analyzing Part 1:**
    * "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today."  
    * "Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers."
    * Combining these, we know that anyone who has lunch at the company building schedules meetings and goes to the building.
    * "If James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager" means that if James is in the company building, he must be a manager. 
    * "No managers work remotely from home" tells us that managers cannot work remotely.
    * Therefore, if James is a manager (and thus in the company building), he cannot have lunch at home or work remotely.
    * "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home" tells us that if James is in other countries, he works remotely from home.
    * This contradicts the fact that managers don't work remotely, so James cannot be both a manager and in other countries.
* **Analyzing Part 2:**
    * "If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home."
    * "No managers work remotely from home."
    * Combining these, we know that if James has lunch at home, he cannot be a manager.
    * "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home" tells us that if James works remotely, he must be in other countries.

Step 3:  Putting it all together, we see that the conclusion holds true.

Step 1: The premises state that "Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness" and "People feel tired when they get the flu".
Step 2: This means that tiredness is a symptom of both Monkeypox and the flu.
Step 3: However, the premises do not say that tiredness is the *only* symptom of either illness.
Step 4:  Therefore, just because tiredness is a symptom of both Monkeypox and the flu, we cannot conclude that no one gets the flu.

Step 2: We also know that "The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies" and "If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list."
Step 3: Therefore, we can conclude that The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
Step 4: Since all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies, and The Legend of Zelda is on the list, we know that The Legend of Zelda was made by a Japanese game company.
Step 5: However, the conclusion states "FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company." There is no information provided in the premises to connect FIFA 22 to The Legend of Zelda or to confirm if FIFA 22 is on the Top 10 list.
Step 6:  We cannot conclude whether FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese game company based on the given information.

Step 1: The premise states that "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies."
Step 2: The premise also states that "A Japanese game company created the game The Legend of Zelda."
Step 3: Therefore, we can conclude that The Legend of Zelda was made by a Japanese game company.
Step 4: The premise states that "If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list."
Step 5: The premise also states that "The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies."
Step 6: Therefore, we can conclude that The Legend of Zelda is included in the Top 10 list.
Step 7:  The conclusion states that "The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list."
Step 8:  Since we concluded in Step 6 that The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: We know from the premise "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels" that Rockie, being spotted near the campus, must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.
Step 2: The premise "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm" tells us that Rockie is calm.
Step 3: The premise "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" implies that if something is calm, it cannot be skittish.
Step 4: The premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" tells us that all squirrels spotted near the campus are skittish.
Step 5: Combining steps 2 and 3, we know Rockie is not skittish.

11 out of 19 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels" that Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.

Step 2: The premise states "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish." This is the statement we are trying to determine the truth value of.

Step 3: We are given that Rockie is calm.

Step 4: The premise "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" tells us that a calm animal cannot be skittish.

Step 5:  We know from the premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" that if Rockie is a squirrel, then it must be skittish.

Step 6: Combining steps 4 and 5, we see that if Rockie is a squirrel, it cannot be calm.

Step 7:  Since Rockie is calm, it cannot be a squirrel.

Step 8:  Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit.

Step 9:  The premise "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" tells us that if Rockie is a rabbit, then it must be cute.

Step 10:  Thus, if Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then it must be cute.

Step 11:  The statement "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish" is therefore true.

12 out of 20 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels," we know that Rockie, being spotted near campus, must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.

Step 2: From the premise "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" and the fact that Rockie is spotted near the campus, we can infer that if Rockie is a rabbit, then Rockie is cute.

Step 3: We are also given that Rockie is calm.

Step 4: The premise "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" tells us that if Rockie is skittish, then Rockie cannot be calm.

Step 5: The premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" implies that if Rockie is a squirrel, then Rockie is skittish.

Step 6: Combining steps 2, 3, and 4, we see that Rockie cannot be both cute and skittish.

Step 7: Therefore, if Rockie is cute and calm, it cannot be a squirrel (due to step 5).

Step 8: This means Rockie must be a rabbit (since the only other possibility is a squirrel, and we've ruled that out).

Step 9:  Since Rockie is a rabbit and rabbits are cute, the premise "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" confirms that Rockie is cute.

Step 10: We also know Rockie is calm.

Step 11: Combining steps 9 and 10, we have a scenario where Rockie is both cute and calm. 

Step 12: However, we cannot definitively conclude that Rockie is a skittish turtle because the premises do not provide any information about turtles being spotted near the campus or their relationship to cuteness or calmness.

Step 1: From the premise "All aliens are extraterrestrials," we know that if something is an alien, it is also an extraterrestrial.
Step 2: From the premise "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien," we know that if someone hails from Mars, they are also an alien.
Step 3: The premise "No extraterrestrials are human" tells us that an extraterrestrial cannot also be human.
Step 4: The premise "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans" states that any highly intelligent being originating from Earth is human.
Step 5: We are given that Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Step 6: Combining step 4 and step 5, we know that if Marvin is from Earth, he is human.
Step 7: However, the premise "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither" tells us that Marvin cannot be from both Earth and Mars.
Step 8:  Therefore, if Marvin is from Earth, he cannot be from Mars.
Step 9: From step 2, we know that if someone is from Mars, they are an alien.
Step 10: Combining steps 7 and 9, we can conclude that if Marvin is from Mars, he is an alien.
Step 11: The premise "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial" tells us that if Marvin is not from Earth, he is an extraterrestrial.
Step 12: From step 1 and step 1, we know that if Marvin is an extraterrestrial, he is also an alien.
Step 13: Combining steps 10 and 12, we can conclude that if Marvin is not from Earth, he is an alien.
Step 14:  Therefore, regardless of whether Marvin is from Mars or not, if he is not from Earth, he is an alien.
Step 15: We have established that Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
Step 16: Since we know that Marvin is an alien if he is not from Earth, and the only other possibility is that he is from both Earth and Mars, we can conclude that Marvin is an alien.

Step 1: From the premise "All aliens are extraterrestrials" we know that if something is an alien, it is also an extraterrestrial.
Step 2: The premise "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien" tells us that if someone hails from Mars, they are classified as an alien.
Step 3: The premise "No extraterrestrials are human" states that there is no overlap between the categories of extraterrestrials and humans; they are mutually exclusive.
Step 4: "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans" implies that if something is both highly intelligent and from Earth, it must be human.
Step 5: We are given that Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Step 6: Marvin's origin is described as "either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither." This means Marvin cannot be from both Earth and Mars, and he cannot be from any other location.
Step 7: "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial" tells us that if Marvin isn't from Earth, he must be an extraterrestrial.
Step 8: Combining steps 3 and 7, we can conclude that if Marvin is not from Earth, he cannot be human.
Step 9: Since Marvin is highly intelligent and cannot be human (step 8), he must be from Earth (step 4).
Step 10: However, step 6 states Marvin is either from Earth and Mars, or from neither. Since he can't be human (step 8) and we've concluded he must be from Earth (step 9), Marvin cannot be from Mars.

Step 1: From the premise "All aliens are extraterrestrials," we know that if someone is an alien, they are also an extraterrestrial.

Step 2: From the premise "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien," we can infer that if someone is from Mars, they are also an alien.

Step 3: The premise "No extraterrestrials are human" states that it's impossible for something to be both an extraterrestrial and a human.

Step 4: The premise "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans" tells us that if something is highly intelligent and from Earth, it must be human.

Step 5: We are given that "Marvin is a highly intelligent being."

Step 6: Combining steps 4 and 5, if Marvin is highly intelligent and from Earth, then Marvin is human.

Step 7: The premise "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither" tells us Marvin's origin is one of these two possibilities.

Step 8: The premise "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial" states that if Marvin isn't from Earth, he must be an extraterrestrial.

Step 9: Combining steps 1, 3, and 8, if Marvin is not from Earth, he is an extraterrestrial, and since no extraterrestrials are human (step 3), Marvin cannot be human if he's not from Earth.

Step 10: Therefore, if Marvin is not from Mars, and he's not from Earth (step 7), then he's not human.

Step 1: We know "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor." This means Djokovic must be one of these two.
Step 2: We also know "Djokovic is at the mixer."
Step 3:  We are given "if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid." This implies that if Djokovic is a famous athlete, he is well-paid, but it doesn't say that all famous athletes are well-paid.
Step 4: We are also given "If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid." and "All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities." This means that all Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are well paid.
Step 5: We are given "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens." This tells us about the location of well-paid people at the mixer, but it doesn't directly tell us about Djokovic's status as a Grand Slam champion.
Step 6: We are given "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player." and "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes." This means that if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he is also a professional tennis player and an athlete.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Djokovic is at the mixer" that Djokovic fits into one of the categories defined in the premises: Grand Slam champion, Oscar-nominated actor, or both.
Step 2: We are given "If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid." This tells us that if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then he is well-paid, but it doesn't confirm he is either.
Step 3: We also know "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes" and "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player". Combining these, we can infer that if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he is a professional tennis player and thus an athlete.
Step 4: If Djokovic is a professional tennis player, then he is an athlete, and if he is an athlete, he is famous. This means if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he is famous.
Step 5:  Since Djokovic is famous, he is well-paid, according to "If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid".
Step 6: We also know "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens".  Therefore, if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he lives in a tax haven.
Step 7: We haven't definitively proven that Djokovic *is* a Grand Slam champion, but the premises don't contradict this possibility either.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says “The theistic God is a sophist.” We also know “Some sophists reason,” which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons.

Step 2: We also know "If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid." This means if Djokovic is a famous athlete, he must be well-paid, but it doesn't mean all famous athletes are well-paid.
Step 3: The premises state that "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes" and "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player." This means if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he is an athlete.
Step 4: If Djokovic is an athlete, he is famous according to the premise "If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous."
Step 5: Since Djokovic is famous, he is well-paid according to the premise "If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid." 
Step 6: Finally, the premise states "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens." Since Djokovic is well-paid, he should live in a tax haven.

Step 1: We know from the premise "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative." that if a design is both interesting and adored by Max, then it must be both a brutalist building and evocative.
Step 2: The premise "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries" tells us that all of Zaha Hadid's design styles adored by Max possess interesting geometries.
Step 3: However, the premise "No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries" directly contradicts this. This contradiction means that it is impossible for a design adored by Max to be both a Zaha Hadid design and a brutalist building. 
Step 4:  The premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style" tells us that there are only two possibilities for a design adored by Max: it is either a Zaha Hadid style or a Kelly Wearstler style. 
Step 5: Therefore, since we've ruled out the possibility of a design being both a Zaha Hadid style and a brutalist building, and every adored design is either Zaha Hadid or Kelly Wearstler, a design adored by Max cannot be a brutalist building.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style" that any design Max adores must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 3: Therefore, if a design by Max that he adores is Kelly Wearstler's, it is both evocative and dreamy.
Step 4: Since the premises do not rule out the possibility that Max adores a Kelly Wearstler design, we can conclude that it is possible for a design by Max to be both evocative and dreamy.

Step 1: We know that "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative" and "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy."
Step 2: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that all of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are both evocative and dreamy.
Step 3:  We also know that "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style."
Step 4: Therefore, any design by Max that he adores must be either a Zaha Hadid design style or a Kelly Wearstler design style.
Step 5: If it's a Kelly Wearstler design, we know from Step 2 that it is both evocative and dreamy. 
Step 6: Since all Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are either evocative or dreamy, the statement "A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy" is true.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek" and "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association."  Therefore, all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
Step 2: We also know that "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis."
Step 3: Combining these two steps, we can deduce that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are among the most active players in major tennis.
Step 4: The premise states that "Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022."
Step 5: We are also given that "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022." This implies that Coco Gauff is either a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 or lost to Rafael Nadal.
Step 6: Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 and all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are among the most active players in major tennis (Step 3), we can conclude that Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players.

28 out of 43 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek."  
Step 2: We also know that "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if Coco Gauff is female, she must have lost to Iga Świątek.
Step 4: We are given that "Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022" and "All tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 are either female or male." Therefore, Coco Gauff must be either female or male.
Step 5: If Coco Gauff is female, she lost to Iga Świątek (Step 3), and if she is male, she lost to Rafael Nadal (premise: "All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal").
Step 6: Therefore, regardless of Coco Gauff's gender, she must have lost to either Iga Świątek or Rafael Nadal. 
Step 7: Since the question asks if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, and we know she lost to one of them, the answer is that it is possible Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal.

The final answer is (A).
</answer>
28 out of 44 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek," we can deduce that if Coco Gauff lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022, then Coco Gauff must be a female tennis player. 

Step 2:  The premise "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022" tells us that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly or lost to Nadal, she cannot be male.

Step 3: We know Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.  

Step 4: Combining the information from steps 1, 2, and 3, we can deduce that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, she must be female, and therefore she could not have lost to Rafael Nadal.

Step 5: Similarly, if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, she could not be ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association because that would mean she's not male.

Step 6:  Therefore, Coco Gauff cannot be both ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association and lost to Rafael Nadal.

Step 7: Since all players who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, and Coco Gauff cannot be both ranked highly and lost to Rafael Nadal, Coco Gauff cannot be both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.

Step 2: The premise "Some pets are not mammals" tells us that there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal.
Step 3:  We cannot definitively conclude that *no* pets are cats based on these premises. It's possible that some pets are cats, and those cats would still be mammals. 
Step 4: The premises don't provide enough information to say for sure whether or not all pets are non-cats.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season" that anyone who desires a long vacation prefers summer.
Step 2: We are also given that "James wants to have a long vacation," meaning James's favorite season must be summer.
Step 3: The premise states that "Emma's favorite season is summer."
Step 4:  We are told that "Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's," meaning Mia's favorite season cannot be summer.
Step 5:  Since we know the four seasons are Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, and we've ruled out summer, Mia's favorite season must be one of the remaining three: Spring, Fall, or Winter. 
Step 6: The provided premises do not give us enough information to determine definitively whether Mia's favorite season is specifically Spring, Fall, or Winter.

Step 3: We know that "No digital media are analog."
Step 4: We know that "Every printed text is analog media."
Step 5: Combining steps 2, 3, and 4, we can conclude that if 1984 is a streaming service, then it cannot be printed text. This contradicts the statement in step 1.
Step 6: Therefore, the premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book" must be false.
Step 7:  Since the premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book" is false, we cannot conclude that 1984 is printed text.

32 out of 49 is correct!
Step 1: We are given the premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book."
Step 2: This premise implies that if 1984 is indeed a streaming service, it must also be a hardcover book.
Step 3: We are also given the premise "If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text."
Step 4: Combining these premises, we can deduce that if 1984 is a streaming service, it is also printed text.
Step 5: The premise "Every printed text is analog media" tells us that anything classified as printed text is analog.
Step 6:  We also have the premise "No digital media are analog."
Step 7: Therefore, if 1984 is a streaming service (and thus printed text), it cannot be digital.
Step 8: However, we know "All streaming services are digital media."
Step 9: This creates a contradiction: 1984 cannot be both a streaming service and not digital.
Step 10: Because the premises lead to a contradiction, the initial assumption that 1984 is a streaming service must be false.

Step 4: However, we are also given that "No digital media are analog" and "Every printed text is analog media."
Step 5: Since streaming services are digital media (given that "All streaming services are digital media"), 1984 cannot be both a streaming service and printed text.

Step 3: We are also given that "French and Spanish are both Romance languages."
Step 4: The premise "German is related to Spanish" tells us that German belongs to the same language family as Spanish.
Step 5:  Crucially, the premise "Basque is not related to any other language" directly contradicts the idea that Basque could be a Romance language, as Romance languages are defined as being related to each other within the Romance language family.

Step 4: The premise states that "German is related to Spanish."
Step 5: However, the premise also states that "Basque is not related to any other language."
Step 6: This implies that the relationship between German and Spanish does not stem from them both being Romance languages, as Basque is unrelated to everything else.

Step 2: The premise "Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US" tells us something about the type of visa he has.
Step 3: We are also given "An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US." This means that if Mike needs to apply for CPT, he likely has an F1 visa.
Step 4:  While it's possible Mike could have a J1 visa and have a specific circumstance allowing him to work under CPT, the premises don't provide information to support that possibility.
Step 5: Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the given information is that Mike has an F1 visa. </nl_cot>

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says “The theistic God is a sophist.” We also know “Some sophists reason,” which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect—He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement “The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher” is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that “William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,” we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

Step 3: The premise states "Alligators are not domesticated animals." and we know Ted is an alligator.
Step 4: Therefore, Ted cannot be a domesticated animal.
Step 5: The premise "Some pets are Brown Swiss Cattle" tells us there are pets that are also Brown Swiss Cattle. 
Step 6: However, we also know Ted is an alligator and alligators are not domesticated animals, so Ted cannot be a pet.

Step 1: The premise states that "Badults is a British Sitcom series starring members of Pappy's." This tells us that at least some members of Pappy's have starred in a show.
Step 2:  The premise also states that "Badults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three." This tells us that Badults, a show starring members of Pappy's, premiered on BBC Three.
Step 3: The conclusion states "No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three." This is a more general claim than the information we have. 
Step 4: We know Badults, starring members of Pappy's, premiered on BBC Three. However, the premises do not rule out the possibility that members of Pappy's may have starred in a show that premiered on BBC Two.

Step 5: Since we lack information to definitively say that *no* members of Pappy's have starred in a show on BBC Two, the conclusion is uncertain.

Step 1: The premise "Some stocks are growth stocks" tells us that there exists at least one stock that is also a growth stock.
Step 2: The premise "KO is a mature stock" tells us that KO belongs to the category of mature stocks.
Step 3: The premise "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund" tells us that if a stock is mature, it is suitable for a retirement fund. 
Step 4:  Since KO is a mature stock, it follows that KO is suitable for a retirement fund. 
Step 5: The conclusion "KO is a stock" is a statement of fact. It is implied by the premise "KO is a mature stock" which itself is a type of stock.

<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
49 out of 71 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund" and "KO is a mature stock." Therefore, we can conclude that KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 2: The premise also states "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund."
Step 3: Combining Step 1 and Step 2, we know that KO is not bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
Step 4: The premise states "All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation."
Step 5: Since KO is not bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, we can conclude that KO is not a growth stock.
Step 6: We are also given that "Some stocks are growth stocks," meaning there are stocks that are growth stocks.
Step 7:  Since KO is not a growth stock, we can definitively say KO is a stock, but not a growth stock.

The final answer is (B).
</answer>
50 out of 72 is correct!
Step 1:  We know from the premise "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund" and "KO is a mature stock" that KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 2: From the premise "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund", we can deduce that if KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, it cannot be suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 3:  This contradicts our finding in Step 1 that KO is suitable for a retirement fund. Therefore, KO cannot be bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
Step 4: The conclusion states "If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile."
Step 5: Since we know from Step 3 that KO cannot be bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, the only possibility left to consider is that KO is a growth stock.
Step 6: The premise "All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation" and our finding in Step 3 that KO is not bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation contradict each other. Therefore, KO cannot be a growth stock.
Step 7: Since neither of the conditions in the conclusion's "if" statement is true for KO, the conclusion is true. </nl_cot>

52 out of 74 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34" that if a plate starts with 35, it cannot start with 34.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34" that all plates from Istanbul start with 34.
Step 3: Since Tom's license plate begins with 35 (given in the premise), it cannot begin with 34.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Hannah works in student jobs on campus" that she fits the condition for the first conditional statement: "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition."
Step 2:  We also know from the premise "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition" that Hannah is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. 
Step 3:  Therefore, the conclusion "Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition" is false. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
53 out of 76 is correct!
Step 1: We know Hannah is at Mary's school. This is directly stated in the premises.
Step 2: We also know that if people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition. Hannah works in student jobs on campus, so we can conclude that she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
Step 3: The premise states "if Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."  This implies a contradiction.  If she needs to earn money, she cannot be neither picky nor needing to earn money.  Therefore, this premise is flawed and cannot be used for logical deduction.
Step 4: We cannot definitively determine whether Hannah is not a picky eater or spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls based on the premises. 
Step 5:  The premises provide a lot of information about the relationship between working student jobs, takeout orders, dining hall preferences, and picky eating habits. However, they do not directly connect Hannah's work situation to her eating habits.

</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (C).
</answer>
53 out of 77 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise that "Hannah is at Mary's school."

Step 2:  We also know from the premise that "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."

Step 3: Combining these premises, we can deduce that Hannah either doesn't need to earn money to help pay for her college tuition or she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

Step 4: From the premise "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition," we can infer that Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

Step 5:  Therefore, from Step 3 and Step 4, we conclude that Hannah is neither picky.

Step 6: The conclusion states that "Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls."

Step 7: Since we have established in Step 5 that Hannah is not picky, the conclusion is true.

Step 1: We know from the premise "No baked sweets are spicy" that if something is a baked sweet, it cannot be spicy.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All cupcakes are baked sweets" that if something is a cupcake, it is also a baked sweet.
Step 3: Combining these two, we can conclude that cupcakes cannot be spicy.
Step 4: The premise "All mala hotpots are spicy" states that all mala hotpots are spicy.
Step 5:  The premise "Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets" tells us that dried Thai chilies have one of three properties: they are spicy, they are mala hotpots, or they are not baked sweets.
Step 6: Since cupcakes are not spicy (Step 3), and dried Thai chilies are either spicy or mala hotpots (Step 5), dried Thai chilies cannot be cupcakes. 
Step 7: Therefore, the statement "Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa" is false.

58 out of 83 is correct!
Step 1: We are given the premise "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews." This means if a restaurant is recommended, it can't have many negative reviews.

Step 2: We also know "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations." This means any restaurant with a rating above 4 is recommended and thus has not received many negative reviews.

Step 3: The premise "Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews" tells us there are restaurants without take-out that have a lot of negative feedback.

Step 4: "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four" means popular restaurants have ratings above 4, and therefore are recommended and have not received many negative reviews.

Step 5: The premise "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents" tells us the store must be recommended (either because of its rating or its popularity).

Step 6: Now, let's analyze the conclusion. It states: "If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service." This statement is a contradiction. 

Step 7: We know the store must be recommended (from Step 5), meaning it cannot have many negative reviews (from Step 1).

Step 8: Therefore, the conclusion is false because it suggests a situation where the Hamden Plaza Subway store could have both many negative reviews and be recommended, which is impossible based on the given premises. </nl_cot>

The final answer is (B).
</answer>
59 out of 84 is correct!
Step 1:  We know from the premise "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations" that if a restaurant has a rating greater than four, then it is listed in Yelp's recommendations.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews" that if a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.

Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if a restaurant has a rating greater than four, then it has not received many negative reviews.

Step 4:  The premise "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents" gives us two possibilities: either the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.

Step 5: We know from the premise "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four" that if a restaurant is popular among local residents, then it has a rating greater than four.

Step 6:  Therefore, if the Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents, it also has a rating greater than four. This means that in either case (rating greater than four or popular among residents), the Hamden Plaza Subway store has not received many negative reviews (from steps 3 and 5).

Step 7:  The conclusion states that "The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews."

Step 8: We have shown that the Hamden Plaza Subway store does not receive many negative reviews, regardless of whether it provides take-out service.

Step 9: Therefore, the statement "The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews" is true.

</answer>
60 out of 85 is correct!
Step 1: We know "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four." 
Step 2: We also know "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that The Hamden Plaza Subway store either has a rating greater than four and is popular among local residents, or it has a rating greater than four and is not popular among local residents.
Step 4: From premise "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations", we can say that if the Hamden Plaza store has a rating greater than four, then it is listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
Step 5: We also know "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews."
Step 6: This means that if the Hamden Plaza store has a rating greater than four, it has not received many negative reviews.
Step 7:  The premise "Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews" does not directly contradict the conclusion that the Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service.
Step 8: Therefore, while we can deduce that the Hamden Plaza store has a rating greater than four and has not received many negative reviews, we cannot definitively conclude that it does not provide take-out service.

Step 1: From the premise "In superhero movies, the good guys always win," we know that if a movie is a superhero movie, then the good guys win.
Step 2: We are given that "The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is a superhero movie," so we can conclude that the good guys win in this movie.
Step 3: We know that "Good guys fight bad guys and vice versa," which means that if someone is a good guy, they fight bad guys.
Step 4: From the premise "If a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is a good guy," and "The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is named after Sir Digby," we can conclude that Sir Digby is a good guy.
Step 5: Since Sir Digby is a good guy (Step 4), and good guys fight bad guys (Step 3), Sir Digby fights a bad guy.
Step 6: We are told "Sir Digby fights his nemesis," so we can conclude that Sir Digby's nemesis is a bad guy.
Step 7: From the premise "If somebody wins a fight, the person they are fighting does not win," we know that if Sir Digby wins the fight, his nemesis does not win.
Step 8: We know from Step 2 that the good guys win in this movie, and Sir Digby is a good guy (Step 4), so Sir Digby wins the fight.
Step 9: Therefore, based on Step 7 and Step 8, we can conclude that Sir Digby's nemesis does not win.

Step 2: The premise also states "If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task."
Step 3: The premise "Machine translation is a natural language processing task" tells us that machine translation falls under one of these two categories.
Step 4: The premise "The output of machine translation is a text sequence"  means that machine translation produces text.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "Cats are pets" and "Fluffy is Tom's cat," so we can conclude that Fluffy is a pet.
Step 2: The premise states "Pets are allowed in some managed buildings," and "The Olive Garden is a managed building," so it's possible for pets to be allowed at The Olive Garden.
Step 3: The premise "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet" implies that if pets are allowed at The Olive Garden, Tom could move in with Fluffy.
Step 4:  The premise states "Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500."
Step 5: We also know "The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000" and "$2000 is more than $1500."  This means the security deposit at The Olive Garden could be $2000 or more.
Step 6: Because the security deposit at The Olive Garden might be more than $1500, the condition in Tom's rental criteria is not met.
Step 7: Therefore, based on the premises, we cannot conclude with certainty that Tom will rent an apartment at The Olive Garden.

Step 1: We know "Pets are allowed in some managed buildings." and "The Olive Garden is a managed building."  Therefore, we can infer that pets are allowed in The Olive Garden.
Step 2: We also know "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet." Since we established pets are allowed at The Olive Garden, we can conclude that people are allowed to move in with pets there.
Step 3: The premise states that "Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500."
Step 4: We know "A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building" and "The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more."
Step 5: We are given that "The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000" and "$2000 is more than $1500." This means the security deposit at The Olive Garden can be $2000 or more.
Step 6: Since the security deposit at The Olive Garden is more than $1500, Tom's condition for renting is not met.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says “The theistic God is a sophist.” We also know “Some sophists reason,” which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All private companies are companies" and "All companies are business organizations" that if something is a private company, it is also a business organization.

Step 2:  From the premise "All business organizations are legal entities," we can deduce that if something is a business organization, it is also a legal entity.

Step 3: Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, it is a business organization, and consequently, a legal entity.

Step 4:  We also know from the premise "All legal entities are created under law" that if something is a legal entity, it is created under law.

Step 5:  The premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company" tells us that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, it cannot be a private company.

Step 6: Combining steps 3 and 4, we know that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, it is a legal entity, and thus created under law.

Step 7:  Therefore, the statement "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law" is true.

69 out of 100 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating" and "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating".
Step 2: Therefore, if Harry is a bee, he cannot have a backbone.
Step 3: We also know that "All vertebrate animals have a backbone".
Step 4: Combining these, if Harry is a vertebrate, he cannot be a bee.
Step 5:  The conclusion states "If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee."
Step 6:  Let's analyze the two possibilities in the conclusion:
    *  If Harry is both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, we know from step 4 that this contradicts the fact that Harry is a bee.
    *  If Harry is neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then he must be an invertebrate (from the premise "Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates").
Step 7:  Therefore, in either scenario, Harry cannot be a queen bee.
Step 8:  Since the conclusion holds true in both possibilities, it is true in general.

Step 1: We are given that Luke is either a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. This is our starting point.
Step 2: Let's analyze the implications of each possibility:
    - **Possibility 1:** Luke is born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers.  This doesn't directly tell us about his time with siblings.
    - **Possibility 2:** Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. This also doesn't directly tell us about his time with siblings.
Step 3:  We need to see if any of the premises can connect Luke's situation to spending time with siblings.
Step 4: The premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings" seems relevant. 
Step 5: However, we don't know if Luke has siblings in Possibility 1. 
Step 6:  Similarly, the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" doesn't help us determine if Luke spends time with siblings because we don't know if he lives at home.
Step 7:  The other premises deal with siblings born together, complaining about siblings, and living with strangers, but they don't directly connect to whether Luke spends time with his siblings.
Step 8:  Since we cannot definitively conclude from the premises whether Luke has siblings or spends time with them, the statement "Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings" is uncertain. 

</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (C).
</answer>
70 out of 102 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" that Luke cannot be both a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, and he cannot be not a baby born in a multiple birth and not live with strangers.

Step 2:  We also know from the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" that if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, he often lives at home.

Step 3: However, the premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers" tells us that if Luke lives at home, he does not live with strangers.

Step 4: Combining steps 1, 2, and 3, we can deduce that if Luke lives with strangers, he cannot spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.

Step 5: The premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings" implies that if Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth, he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.

Step 6: Therefore, if Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth, he cannot live with strangers.

Step 7: Combining steps 1, 4, and 6, we can conclude that if Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth, he does not live with strangers, and therefore he must spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.

Step 8: Since we know that if people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home (premise 5), we can conclude that Luke often lives at home.

Step 9:  The premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth" implies that if Luke has siblings who were born together, then he was born in a multiple birth.

Step 10:  Combining steps 7 and 9, we can conclude that if Luke has siblings who were born together, he often lives at home.

Step 11:  The premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together" implies that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, he has siblings who were born together.

Step 12: Combining steps 10 and 11, we can conclude that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, he often lives at home.



Step 13: Since we already concluded that Luke often lives at home (step 8), we can conclude that Luke complains often about annoying siblings.

70 out of 103 is correct!
Step 1: We know Luke is either "a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers" or "not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers". 

Step 2: From the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home", we can infer that if Luke lives at home, he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.

Step 3: From the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth", we can infer that if Luke was born in a multiple birth, he has siblings who were born together.

Step 4: From the premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together", we can infer that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, he has siblings who were born together.

Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can see that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings or is born in a multiple birth, he has siblings who were born together.

Step 6: We also know from the premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers". This means that if Luke lives at home, he does not live with strangers.

Step 7:  Since Luke is either "a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers" or "not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers", we can deduce that if Luke lives at home, he cannot be "a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers".

Step 8: Combining steps 2, 5, and 7, we can conclude that if Luke lives at home, he does not complain often about annoying siblings.

Step 9: Therefore, Luke is either "not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" or "a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers".

Step 10:  Since Luke is either "a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" or "not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers", and we know that he does not complain often about annoying siblings if he lives at home, we can conclude that Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.

Step 1: The premise states that "ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship." This means that at least some GRE test takers can receive financial aid from ETS.
Step 2: We also know that "Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship." 
Step 3: Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources, meaning he could potentially qualify for financial aid.
Step 4: Therefore, it is possible for at least some GRE test takers to receive financial aid.


Step 5: The conclusion states "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something." This is too strong of a statement. Since we know it's possible for at least some GRE test takers to receive financial aid, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: From the premise "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy," we know that if someone spills a lot of food on their clothing, they cannot be notably tidy. 

Step 2: The premise states "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing."

Step 3: Combining Steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that all clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are not notably tidy.

Step 4: The premise states "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy."

Step 5: The premise states "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly."

Step 6: The premise states "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness."

Step 7:  Combining Steps 4, 5, and 6, we can conclude that all people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness are notably tidy.

Step 8: The premise states "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly."

Step 9:  We cannot definitively determine whether Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness from the given information.

75 out of 108 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly." This sets up our two possible scenarios for Peter.
Step 2: Let's analyze the first scenario: "Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly."
Step 3: The premise "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy" tells us that if Peter spills a lot of food, he cannot be notably tidy.
Step 4:  The premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy" states that if Peter is cleanly, he must be notably tidy. 
Step 5:  These two premises contradict each other, meaning Peter cannot simultaneously be both a person who spills a lot of food and cleanly. Therefore, the first scenario is impossible.
Step 6: This leaves us with the second scenario: "Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly."
Step 7:  The premise "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" tells us that if Peter values order and spotlessness, he must be cleanly.
Step 8: The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter himself values order and spotlessness.
Step 9: Since Peter is not cleanly, he cannot value order and spotlessness. Therefore, Peter's family cannot prioritize order and spotlessness.
Step 10: We can conclude that Peter is not a person who values order and spotlessness, and we know he does not spill a lot of food on his clothing. 
Step 11:  The only remaining option is that Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, as stated in the premise "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing."

</answer>
75 out of 109 is correct!
Step 1: Analyze Peter's characteristics:  The premise states Peter is either "a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly" or "a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly."

Step 2:  Examine the implications of being a "person who spills a lot of food on his clothing": The premise "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy" tells us that someone who spills a lot of food is not notably tidy.

Step 3: Connect "not notably tidy" with "cleanly": The premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy" means that if someone is cleanly, they must be notably tidy.  Therefore, Peter cannot be both "a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing" and "cleanly."

Step 4:  Consider the characteristics of "clumsy foodies": The premise "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing" tells us that clumsy foodies who go out frequently spill a lot of food.

Step 5:  Relate "value order and spotlessness" to Peter: The premises "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" and "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" imply that someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness will value it themselves and thus be cleanly.

Step 6: Analyze the conclusion: The conclusion states Peter is either "both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness" or "neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness."

Step 7:  Determine the truth of the conclusion: Since Peter cannot be both "a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing" and "cleanly," and clumsy foodies who go out frequently spill a lot of food, Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently and someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness. Therefore, the conclusion holds true.

Step 1:  We know from the premise "All fir trees are evergreens" that if something is a fir tree, it is also an evergreen.
Step 2: The premise "Some objects of worship are fir trees" tells us there exist at least some objects of worship that are also fir trees.
Step 3:  However, the premises do not state that *all* objects of worship are fir trees.  There could be objects of worship that are not fir trees.
Step 4: Since there could be objects of worship that are not fir trees, and fir trees are evergreens, it follows that there must be some evergreens that are not objects of worship.

Step 3: The third premise states that the Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.
Step 4: The fourth premise tells us that there are no mountain ranges in Texas with donated mines.
Step 5: Combining the information from steps 3 and 4, we can deduce that the Picuris Mountains must be located in New Mexico because a donated mine exists within them, and such mines don't exist in Texas mountain ranges.

Step 3: Combining these two statements, we can deduce that the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas.
Step 4:  The premise "The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas" tells us the Picuris Mountains are either in New Mexico or Texas.
Step 5: Since we've established the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas, they must be in New Mexico.

Step 3: Combining Step 1 and Step 2, we can conclude that all Tesla Model 3s are not one-seaters.
Step 4: The premise "All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters" states that any car that is both single-seat and electric is also a one-seater.
Step 5: The premise "All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars" tells us that Solo EV cars are both single-seat and electric.
Step 6: Therefore, we can conclude that all Solo EV cars are one-seaters.
Step 7: The premise "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" is a conditional statement. It means that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it cannot be either a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
Step 8: Since we know that Tesla Model 3s are not one-seaters and Solo EV cars are one-seaters, the only way for John's car to fit the condition in Step 7 is if it is a Tesla Model 3.

Step 2: The premise "All monkeys are mammals" tells us that any animal classified as a monkey is also a mammal.

Step 3: We are given that "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds."

Step 4: The premise "Peter's birds can fly" states that all birds belonging to Peter can fly.

Step 5: "All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe" means any animal owned by Peter has the ability to breathe.

Step 6: The premise "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings" establishes a relationship: if a pet of Peter's can fly, it must have wings.

Step 7:  The premise "Rock is Peter's pet" tells us that Rock is one of Peter's animals.

Step 8: The premise "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe" provides three possibilities for Rock.

Step 9: To determine if Rock is a monkey, we need to see if it fits the criteria of being a mammal and a pet of Peter. We know all of Peter's pets are either monkeys or birds.

Step 1: We know that "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged."  This means if someone makes wedding plans, they must be engaged.

Step 2: We also know that "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans." This means if someone invites others to their ceremony, they automatically make wedding plans.

Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can deduce that if someone invites others to their ceremony, they must be engaged.

Step 4: The premise states "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans." This contradicts our deduction in step 3.

Step 5: Therefore, we can conclude that John is not engaged.

Step 6: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" is relevant here. Since we know John is not engaged and thus doesn't invite friends to their ceremony (from step 4), this leaves the possibility that John has a larger family and thus has a well-attended wedding.

Step 7: However, the premises do not explicitly state that John has a larger family. They only state that *if* John has a larger family, then he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.

Step 8: Since we cannot definitively confirm John has a larger family based on the given premises, the conclusion is uncertain. </nl_cot>

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... </answer>`.  \n- If no valid mode is detected, return: `<error> Mode not specified. </error>` Do not attempt to infer one.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: given premises "If Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry." and "The Hulk wakes up when he is angry.", we can know "If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up."\nStep 2: given premise "If the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge." and derivation "If Thor is happy, then hulk wakes up.", we can know "If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge."\nStep 3: given premise "The Hulk is a destroyer." and derivation "If Thor is happy, then hulk will break a bridge.", we can know "If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge."\nStep 4: given premise "Peter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge." and derivation "If Thor is happy, then a destroyer will break a bridge.", we can know "If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian"\nStep 5: given premise "Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian." and derivation "If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is not a civilian", we can know "If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero."\nStep 6: given premise "Peter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero." and derivation "If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker is a superhero.", we can know "If Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform"\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 1>\n\n<EXAMPLE 2>\n<premises>\nAll philosophers reason.\nSome sophists reason.\nAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood.\nNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is morally perfect.\nThe theistic God is a sophist.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise “All philosophers reason,” we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise “All who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,” we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise “Nobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect” implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be “morally perfect,” if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says “The theistic God is a sophist.” We also know “Some sophists reason,” which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect—He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement “The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher” is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that “William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,” we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement “William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university” remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAll people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.\nAll people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.\nAnyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.\nSome people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.\nIf John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.\nIf John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. \n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nJohn does not have a larger family.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Step 2: Combining this with the premise "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged," we can conclude that if John is engaged, he is not a person who makes wedding plans.
Step 3: From the premise "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans," we can deduce that if John invites others to their ceremony, then he makes wedding plans.
Step 4: Since we know from Step 2 that John doesn't make wedding plans if he's engaged, and Step 3 states he does if he invites others, we can conclude that John cannot be engaged and invite others to his ceremony.
Step 5:  The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, he must either have a well-attended wedding or invite friends to his ceremony.
Step 6: From Step 4, we know that John cannot both be engaged and invite others to his ceremony.
Step 7: We also know that "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony," meaning that if John has a well-attended wedding, he must invite others to his ceremony.
Step 8: Therefore, if John has a larger family, he must have a well-attended wedding and, consequently, invite others to his ceremony. This contradicts our conclusion in Step 4.
Step 9: Therefore, John cannot have a larger family.

86 out of 129 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged" that if someone makes wedding plans, they must be engaged.

Step 2: The premise "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans" tells us that anyone inviting others to their ceremony is also making wedding plans.

Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that anyone who invites others to their ceremony is engaged.

Step 4: The premise "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans" states that if John is engaged, he would not be inviting friends or making wedding plans. This contradicts our conclusion from steps 1-3.

Step 5: Therefore, based on the premises, it is impossible for John to be engaged.

The final answer is (B).
</answer>
86 out of 130 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise “All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged,” we know that if someone makes wedding plans, they must be engaged. 
Step 2: The premise “If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans” tells us that if John is engaged, he cannot simultaneously invite friends and make wedding plans. 
Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that if John makes wedding plans, he cannot be engaged, and if he is engaged, he cannot make wedding plans. This means John cannot be engaged and make wedding plans.
Step 4: The premise “All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans” implies that if someone invites others to their ceremony, they must make wedding plans.
Step 5: Therefore, if John invites others to his ceremony, he must make wedding plans, contradicting our conclusion from step 3.
Step 6: This means John cannot invite others to his ceremony.
Step 7: The premise “If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony” tells us that if John has a larger family, he must either have a well-attended wedding or invite friends to his ceremony. 
Step 8: Since we already established that John cannot invite friends to his ceremony (Step 6), if he has a larger family, he must have a well-attended wedding. 
Step 9:  However, the conclusion states that John neither has a larger family nor invites others to his wedding. 
Step 10:  We cannot definitively say whether John has a larger family or not, as the premises do not provide enough information to conclude that.

Step 1: The premise states that "Platypuses are mammals."
Step 2: The premise also states that "Platypuses have no teeth."
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth."

The final answer is (A).
</answer>
87 out of 132 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states "Platypuses are mammals."
Step 2: The premise also states "Some mammals have teeth."
Step 3: The premise "Platypuses have no teeth" contradicts the fact that some mammals have teeth.
Step 4: The conclusion states "Platypuses are reptiles." There is no information provided in the premises to support this statement. 
Step 5:  Since the premises do not support the conclusion, the statement "Platypuses are reptiles" is false. </nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
87 out of 133 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states "Platypuses are mammals."
Step 2: The premise states "Humans have teeth."
Step 3: The premise "Some mammals have teeth"  is consistent with the fact that humans have teeth, as humans are mammals. 
Step 4: The premise "Platypuses have no teeth" tells us that not all mammals have teeth.
Step 5: The fact that humans have teeth does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that humans are mammals.
Step 6: However, we are given the premise "Platypuses are mammals" and that platypuses are a subset of mammals.
Step 7: Since the conclusion "Humans are mammals" is directly supported by a given premise, it is true.

Step 1: The premise states "Plungers suck," "Vacuums suck," and "Vampires suck." 
Step 2: The premise also states "Space is a vacuum."
Step 3: From steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that if something is a vacuum, then it sucks.
Step 4:  Since space is a vacuum, it follows that space sucks. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
88 out of 135 is correct!
Step 1: The premises state that "Plungers suck," "Vacuums suck," and "Vampires suck." This establishes a connection between the word "suck" and objects that are unpleasant or undesirable.
Step 2: The premise "Space is a vacuum" tells us that space is similar to a vacuum.
Step 3: We are also given that "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck," implying that a "duster" is a positive or desirable object.
Step 4:  The conclusion states "Space is a vampire."  
Step 5: Based on the premises, we only know that space resembles a vacuum, which is associated with the negative connotation of "suck." We have no information linking vacuums to vampires, nor do we have any information about the characteristics of vampires beyond that they "suck."

Step 6:  Therefore, the conclusion that "Space is a vampire" is a leap in logic. We cannot definitively say that something that resembles a vacuum is also a vampire. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (C).
</answer>
89 out of 136 is correct!
Step 1: The premises state that "Plungers suck," "Vacuums suck," and "Vampires suck." This establishes that the word "suck" can have different meanings in different contexts.
Step 2: The premise "Space is a vacuum" connects the word "vacuum" to a concept distinct from household appliances.
Step 3: The premise "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck" directly contradicts the conclusion. 
Step 4: Since the premises include examples of household appliances that both suck and don't suck, we cannot definitively conclude that all household appliances suck.

Step 1: We know from the premise "The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms" that the model utilizes machine learning.
Step 2: We also know "Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning." This tells us the possible types of machine learning used.
Step 3: The premise "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" eliminates one possibility.
Step 4: The premise "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data" is crucial. This tells us the model used is not unsupervised learning, as unsupervised learning does not require labeled data.
Step 5: By process of elimination, the only remaining option is supervised learning, as it is the type of machine learning that requires labeled data.

90 out of 138 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms" that the model uses machine learning.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data" that the algorithm used for training text summarization models needs labeled data.
Step 3: The premise "Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data" tells us that unsupervised learning does not need labeled data.
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that the state-of-the-art text summarization model is not trained using unsupervised learning because it requires labeled data.
Step 5: The premise "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" eliminates reinforcement learning as an option.
Step 6: Since supervised learning is the only remaining type of machine learning that uses labeled data, we can conclude that supervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.

Step 1: We know that "All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience."
Step 2: We also know that "All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films."
Step 3: However, the premise does not state that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is in the Frozen series.
Step 4: We are given that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. 
Step 5: If "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film, then it is rated General Audience (from Step 1).
Step 6: If "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages, then it is also rated General Audience (from the first premise).
Step 7: Since either of these scenarios leads to the conclusion that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is rated General Audience, we can confidently say the statement is true. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
91 out of 140 is correct!
Step 1: We know "All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience." and "All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films." Therefore, all movies in the Frozen series are rated General Audience.
Step 2: We also know "If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages." Therefore, all movies in the Frozen series are appropriate for people of all ages.
Step 3: The premise states "“Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages."
Step 4:  We know that all movies in the Frozen series are appropriate for people of all ages and that "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages. This means "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" cannot be a movie in the Frozen series, otherwise, it would be both a family-friendly animated film and appropriate for people of all ages.
Step 5:  The premise states "If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents." and "If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents."
Step 6: Since "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages, it cannot contain excessive erotic and violent content.
Step 7: Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is not in the Frozen series.

92 out of 141 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for all ages.
Step 2: All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
Step 3: If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
Step 4: Therefore, if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film, it is appropriate for all ages.
Step 5: If "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents (from the first premise).
Step 6: Conversely, if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content, then children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents (from the second premise).
Step 7: We also know that all movies in the "Frozen" series are family-friendly animated films.
Step 8: Combining steps 5 and 6, we can conclude that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" either fits the criteria for children to watch without guidance (meaning it's not excessively violent or erotic) or it doesn't (meaning it does contain excessive erotic and violent content).
Step 9: The conclusion states that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.
Step 10:  The only way "Hachi: A dog's Tale" could be in the "Frozen" series is if it is a family-friendly animated film (from step 7). 
Step 11: Since we know it's either family-friendly or contains excessive content, it cannot be both in the "Frozen" series and contain excessive content.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals" that breeding back inherently involves artificial selection.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs" that Heck cattle were specifically bred back.
Step 3: Therefore, since Heck cattle were bred back, and breeding back is a form of artificial selection, we can conclude that some Heck cattle are artificially selected. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
94 out of 143 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs." This implies that aurochs existed before the 1920s.
Step 2: The premise also states that "Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals." This means that there are animals that have gone extinct and are being recreated through breeding programs.
Step 3: Since Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs, and the premise states that some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals, we can conclude that aurochs must be extinct.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election" that if someone can register to vote in the United States, they can participate in the 2024 election. 
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States" that if someone has United States citizenship, they can register to vote.
Step 3: The premise states "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship," meaning someone cannot have both.
Step 4: The premise "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship" implies that if someone is a Russian Federation official, they cannot have Taiwanese citizenship.
Step 5: We are given "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom." This tells us Vladimir is not a manager at Gazprom and does not hold Taiwanese citizenship.
Step 6: Combining steps 3 and 5, we know Vladimir must have United States citizenship.
Step 7: Using steps 2 and 6, we can conclude that Vladimir can register to vote in the United States.
Step 8: The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" does not provide any direct information about Vladimir. 
Step 9: Therefore, we cannot conclude that Vladimir is a Russian Federation official based on the given premises. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (C).
</answer>
95 out of 145 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom," we know that Vladimir is not a Taiwanese citizen and is not a manager at Gazprom.
Step 2: The premise states "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship." This means that if someone is a Russian Federation official, they cannot hold Taiwanese citizenship. Since we know Vladimir is not a Taiwanese citizen, this premise doesn't directly contradict anything about his potential status as a Russian Federation official.
Step 3: The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" presents two possibilities for Ekaterina.
Step 4: The premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election" and "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States" lead us to the conclusion that if someone can register to vote in the US, they must be a US citizen.
Step 5: However, none of the premises directly link Vladimir's citizenship status to his potential role as a Russian Federation official. We cannot definitively conclude whether or not Vladimir is a Russian Federation official based on the given information.

96 out of 146 is correct!
Step 1:  We know that "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election."
Step 2: We also know that "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States."
Step 3: Combining these two, we can infer that "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election."
Step 4: The premise states "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship."
Step 5: The premise "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship" and "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom" tells us nothing about Ekaterina.
Step 6: The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" means Ekaterina either fulfills the condition for voting (citizenship) or is a Russian Federation official.
Step 7:  Since we know that if someone has US citizenship, they can participate in the election, and Ekaterina either has US citizenship or is a Russian Federation official, we can conclude that Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or is a Russian federation official.

97 out of 147 is correct!
Step 1:  From the premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election," we know that if someone can register to vote in the US, they can participate in the election.

Step 2:  From the premise "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States," we know that having US citizenship is a prerequisite for voter registration.

Step 3:  The premise states "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship." This means someone cannot have both.

Step 4:  The premise "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship" tells us that Russian Federation officials cannot be Taiwanese citizens.

Step 5:  The premise "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom" means Vladimir is neither a Taiwanese citizen nor a Gazprom manager.

Step 6:  The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" gives us two possibilities for Ekaterina: either she's registered to vote or she's a Russian Federation official.

Step 7:  Since we know Russian Federation officials cannot be Taiwanese citizens (Step 4), and Vladimir is neither a Taiwanese citizen nor a Gazprom manager (Step 5), we can conclude that Vladimir cannot be a Russian Federation official.

Step 8:  Therefore, the only way for the statement "Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom" to be false is if Ekaterina cannot register to vote in the US (and thus cannot participate) AND Vladimir is NOT a manager at Gazprom.

Step 9:  The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official"  tells us that Ekaterina MUST be able to register to vote or be a Russian Federation official.  Since we know Vladimir is not a Russian Federation official (Step 7), Ekaterina must be able to register to vote.

Step 10: Since Ekaterina can register to vote (Step 9), she can participate in the election (Step 1).

98 out of 148 is correct!
Step 1:  We need to analyze the statement "It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election." 
Step 2: This statement is equivalent to saying "Ekaterina cannot register to vote in the United States OR Vladimir cannot participate in the 2024 United States presidential election."
Step 3: Let's break down each part:
    * **Ekaterina:** We know "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official." This means if Ekaterina is *not* a Russian federation official, she *can* register to vote.
    * **Vladimir:**  We know "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election." So, if Vladimir can register to vote, he can participate. 
Step 4: To determine if Vladimir can register to vote, we need to examine his citizenship:
    *  We know "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship."
    * We also know "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship." 
    * Vladimir is neither a Taiwanese citizen nor a manager at Gazprom, so he could potentially be a US citizen.
Step 5:  We can't definitively say Vladimir is *not* a US citizen based on the premises.
Step 6: Therefore, we can't definitively say Ekaterina *cannot* register to vote and Vladimir *cannot* participate in the election. 
Step 7:  Because we lack sufficient information to confirm either part of the statement "Ekaterina cannot register to vote in the United States OR Vladimir cannot participate in the 2024 United States presidential election," the original statement is uncertain.

100 out of 151 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "New Vessel Press is a publishing house specializing in translating foreign literature into English." This means that all books published by New Vessel Press are translations from other languages.
Step 2: We also know that "Neapolitan Chronicles was translated from Italian" and that "Neapolitan Chronicles is a book published by New Vessel Press."
Step 3: Since all books published by New Vessel Press are translations, and Neapolitan Chronicles is one of them and was translated from Italian, we can infer that New Vessel Press publishes Italian literature.
Step 4: Finally, we know "Palace of Flies is a book published by New Vessel Press."  Therefore, Palace of Flies must also be a translation from another language.
Step 5: While we don't know for sure what language Palace of Flies was translated from, we can conclude that it was translated from a language other than English.

Step 1: We know that "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds" and "All alkanes are hydrocarbons". Therefore, all alkanes are organic compounds.
Step 2: We also know that "All organic compounds are chemical compounds". Therefore, all alkanes are chemical compounds.
Step 3: The premise "All organic compounds contain carbon" tells us that all alkanes contain carbon.
Step 4: The statement "The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither" means the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element. 
Step 5: Since all alkanes are chemical compounds and contain carbon, and the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element, the mixture must contain carbon.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds" and "All alkanes are hydrocarbons." Therefore, all alkanes are organic compounds.
Step 2: We also know that "All organic compounds are chemical compounds." So, all alkanes are chemical compounds.
Step 3: The premise states that "All organic compounds contain carbon." Since all alkanes are organic compounds, all alkanes contain carbon.
Step 4: The final premise states that "The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither." This means the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element.
Step 5: Since all alkanes are chemical compounds and contain carbon, and the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element, the mixture must be an alkane and contain carbon.

</answer>
101 out of 154 is correct!
Step 1:  We know from the premises that "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds" and "All alkanes are hydrocarbons".  Therefore, all alkanes are organic compounds.

Step 2: We also know that "All organic compounds are chemical compounds" and "All organic compounds contain carbon".

Step 3: Combining these, we can conclude that all alkanes are chemical compounds that contain carbon.

Step 4: The premise states "No chemical compounds contain only one element".

Step 5: The premise also states "The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither".  

Step 6:  From steps 3 and 4, we know that if the mixture is a chemical compound, it cannot contain only one element.

Step 7: Therefore, if the mixture contains only one element, it cannot be a chemical compound.

Step 8: Combining steps 3 and 7, we know that if the mixture contains only one element, it cannot be an alkane either.

Step 9: Similarly, if the mixture contains carbon, it must be a chemical compound (step 2).

Step 10: Since we already know from step 7 that a mixture containing only one element cannot be a chemical compound, the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element.

Step 11: Therefore, if the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then it cannot be both a chemical compound and an alkane.

Step 12: This means the statement "If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane" is true.

Step 2: From the premise "If George has access to a program, he can compose," we know that if George has access to a program, then he has the capability to compose.
Step 3: The premise "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose" tells us that if George has both the ability and the desire to compose, then he will actually compose music.
Step 4:  We want to determine if "If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose" is true. This means we need to show that if both conditions (liking music and having access to a program) are met, then composing will definitely occur.
Step 5:  Based on the premises, we know:
    - If George likes music, he wants to compose.
    - If George has access to a program, he can compose.
    - If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.
Step 6:  Therefore, if George likes music (wants to compose) AND has access to a program (can compose), then according to the third premise, he will compose.

106 out of 161 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose" that if George can compose and wants to compose, then he will definitely compose.
Step 2:  The question asks about the case where George will not compose. This means he will not fulfill the "will compose" part of the premise from Step 1.
Step 3: Therefore, we can conclude that if George will not compose, then either he cannot compose or he does not want to compose (or both).  
Step 4: The statement "If George will not compose, George can not compose" is a stronger statement than our conclusion in Step 3. It asserts that the only reason George won't compose is because he *cannot* compose.
Step 5: Our premises don't rule out the possibility that George might not want to compose, even if he can. 
Step 6:  Since the premises don't guarantee that George can't compose if he won't compose, the statement is uncertain.

</answer>
108 out of 164 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV" that there exists at least one show that meets this criteria.
Step 2: The premise "If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor" states that if a show gives out roses on TV, it must be an episode of The Bachelor.
Step 3: We also know from the premises that "The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people" and "All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows".
Step 4: The premise "Breaking Bad is a show" and "Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show" tells us that Breaking Bad is a show but not a reality TV show.
Step 5: Since The Bachelor is a reality TV show, and Breaking Bad is not, they cannot be the same show.
Step 6: Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot be the show that gives out roses at 8 pm on Monday, as per the premise. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
109 out of 165 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise “If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor,” we know that if roses are given out, the show must be The Bachelor.

Step 2: We are given that “The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.” and “All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows,” which means The Bachelor is a reality TV show.

Step 3: We are also told that “Breaking Bad is a show” and “Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.” This directly contradicts the fact that The Bachelor is a reality TV show, meaning it cannot be Breaking Bad.

Step 4: Therefore, if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, it cannot be an episode of The Bachelor.

Step 5: The premise states “Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV,” but it does not say that *only* shows airing at 8 pm on Monday give out roses.

Step 6: Since roses being given out during Breaking Bad implies it is The Bachelor (Step 1), and Breaking Bad cannot be The Bachelor (Step 3), we can conclude that roses being given out during Breaking Bad cannot be connected to it being on Monday at 8 pm.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Severe cancers are deadly diseases" that if something is a severe cancer, then it is a deadly disease.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate" that if something is a deadly disease, it has a low survival rate.
Step 3: The premises do not explicitly state that colorectal cancer is a severe cancer. 
Step 4: Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer based on the given information. 

</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (C).
</answer>
113 out of 170 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate" that if something is deadly, it has a low survival rate.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Severe cancers are deadly diseases" that if something is a severe cancer, it is a deadly disease.
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if something is a severe cancer, it comes with a low survival rate.
Step 4: The premise states that "Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer" and "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer". Therefore, if something is bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma, it is a severe form of cancer.
Step 5: From steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that if something is bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma, it comes with a low survival rate.
Step 6: The premise states that "Mild flu comes with a low survival rate". This tells us that mild flu has a low survival rate, but it does not say anything about whether it is a kind of bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma.
Step 7: The premise also states that "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate". This tells us that colorectal cancer cannot be both a bile duct cancer and have a low survival rate.
Step 8: We want to know if the statement "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu" is true.
Step 9:  From steps 5 and 7, we know that if colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma, it must have a low survival rate.
Step 10: However, we also know from step 7 that colorectal cancer cannot have a low survival rate and be a bile duct cancer.
Step 11: Therefore, the statement "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu" is false.

<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
113 out of 171 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate." that deadly diseases have low survival rates.
Step 2:  We also know "Severe cancers are deadly diseases." Therefore, severe cancers have a low survival rate.
Step 3: The premise states "Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer." So, bile duct cancer is a severe cancer and therefore has a low survival rate.
Step 4:  The premise "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer" means that if something is Cholangiocarcinoma, it is also bile duct cancer.
Step 5: We are given that "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate." This tells us that colorectal cancer cannot be both a bile duct cancer and have a low survival rate.
Step 6:  We also know "Mild flu comes with a low survival rate."
Step 7: Combining steps 3, 4, and 5, we can conclude that colorectal cancer cannot be Cholangiocarcinoma because it cannot have a low survival rate (a characteristic of bile duct cancer) and be colorectal cancer simultaneously.
Step 8: Therefore, the statement "Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above" is false.

Step 1: From the premise "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly," we know that if someone grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then they eat salads regularly.

Step 2: From the premise "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes," we know that if someone fulfills their daily nutritional intakes, they grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.

Step 3: From the premise "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes," we know that if someone visits the gym at least once a day, they fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.

Step 4: We are told that Taylor either "grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither." This means Taylor's situation is one of two possibilities: she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being, or she did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home and does not disregard her physical well-being.

Step 5: Since we don't know if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, we cannot definitively say whether she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.

Step 6: Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, and consequently, we cannot definitively say whether she eats salads regularly.

The final answer is (C).
</answer>
115 out of 173 is correct!
Step 1: We know "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes." and "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly."
Step 2: Combining these, we can deduce that all people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes eat salads regularly.
Step 3: We also know "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits."
Step 4: Therefore, all people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
Step 5: The premise states "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits."
Step 6: This means that if Taylor disregards her physical well-being, she cannot be very conscious about her health and eating habits.
Step 7: Taylor's situation is described as "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither."
Step 8: This means Taylor cannot fulfill both conditions simultaneously: being very conscious about her health and eating habits (which we deduced from fulfilling daily nutritional intakes) and disregarding her physical well-being.
Step 9: The premise "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes" tells us that visiting the gym at least once a day is a sufficient condition for fulfilling daily nutritional intakes.
Step 10: Since Taylor cannot be both very conscious about her health and eating habits and disregard her physical well-being, we can conclude that she must fulfill her daily nutritional intakes.
Step 11: Therefore, Taylor must visit the gym at least once a day. </nl_cot>

115 out of 174 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly" and "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits," we can conclude that all people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
Step 2: From the premise "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes," we can conclude that all people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
Step 3: Combining Steps 1 and 2, we can say that everyone who is very conscious about their health and eating habits either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home or fulfills their daily nutritional intakes.
Step 4: From the premise "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits," we can conclude that people who disregard their physical well-being do not fall into the category of those who are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
Step 5:  The premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither" tells us Taylor cannot be both health-conscious and disregard her physical well-being.
Step 6: Since Taylor cannot be both health-conscious and disregard her physical well-being, she must fall into one of the following categories: 1) grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and is conscious about her health and eating habits, or 2) did neither.
Step 7: If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she would be conscious about her health and eating habits, which contradicts the premise that she either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being, or she did neither. Therefore, Taylor cannot have grown up in a health-conscious childhood home.
Step 8: We know that if people visit the gym at least once a day, they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Step 9: We also know that people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
Step 10: Since Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, she is not automatically excluded from fulfilling her daily nutritional intakes or visiting the gym.  Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether or not Taylor visits the gym at least once a day.

Step 2: From the premise "All animal lovers are nice to animals," and our deduction that Tom loves animals, we can conclude that Tom is nice to animals.
Step 3: The premise "No one nice to animals is also mean to animals" tells us that if someone is nice to animals, they cannot also be mean to animals.
Step 4: The premise "Some grumpy people are mean to animals" states that there are grumpy people who exhibit mean behavior towards animals.
Step 5: We have established that Tom is nice to animals (Step 2).
Step 6:  Since Tom is nice to animals, he cannot also be mean to animals (Step 3).
Step 7:  Therefore, Tom cannot be one of the grumpy people who are mean to animals (Step 4).

Step 2:  We also know that "Tom is a pet owner" and "All pet owners love animals," so Tom is an animal lover.
Step 3: Since Tom is an animal lover, he cannot be mean to animals (from Step 1).
Step 4: The statement we are evaluating is "If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover."
Step 5: Since Tom is an animal lover (Step 2) and cannot be mean to animals (Step 3), the premise of the statement "If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals" is automatically true.

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect—He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement “The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher” is false.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain? William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</question> \n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: The premise states that “William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.” We also know that “The University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom,” so we can confirm that William Dickinson’s university education took place in the UK.\nStep 2: However, the premise does not explicitly state that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that “William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,” we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement “William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university” remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n</answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nEvents are either happy or sad.\nAt least one event is happy. \n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAll events are sad.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Step 1: The premise states "At least one event is happy." This means there exists at least one event that is classified as happy.
Step 2: The premise also states "Events are either happy or sad." This implies that every event must fall into one of these two categories. 
Step 3: Since there exists at least one happy event, it's impossible for *all* events to be sad.

Step 1: We know from the premise "One six-way tie was on the leaderboard, and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium." that there was a six-way tie on the leaderboard, and at least one person from Belgium was part of that tie.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic" that Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard.
Step 3: Since Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard, and there was a six-way tie with at least one Belgian participant, it logically follows that Descampe must be in the six-way tie.

Step 1: From the premise "Jane does not like any animals that bark" and "All dogs are animals that bark", we can deduce that Jane does not like dogs.
Step 2: From the premise "Jane likes all animals that jump" and "If an animal has legs, then it jumps", we can deduce that Jane likes all animals that have legs.
Step 3: From the premise "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs" we can deduce that all terricolous animals have legs.
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that Jane likes all terricolous animals.
Step 5: The premise "KiKi is an animal" tells us that KiKi is a member of the set of all animals.
Step 6: The premise "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs" tells us that if KiKi does not jump or have legs, then it must be terricolous or have legs.
Step 7: Since we know Jane likes all terricolous animals (step 4) and KiKi is an animal (step 5), it follows that if KiKi is terricolous, Jane likes KiKi.
Step 8: We don't know for sure if KiKi is terricolous, so we can't definitively say whether Jane likes KiKi. 
Step 9: Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that KiKi is terricolous.

Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /beacon-scratch/tongzh24/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

 14%|█▍        | 1/7 [00:05<00:33,  5.66s/it]Step 1: We know from the premise "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school." that Bonnie's situation is one of two possibilities: 
   - She attends and is very engaged with school events, AND is a student who attends the school.
   - She does NOT attend and is very engaged with school events, AND is NOT a student who attends the school.

Step 2:  The premise "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events" tells us that if someone in the club performs in talent shows often, they must attend and be very engaged with school events.

Step 3:  The premise "All people in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school" means that if someone in the club chaperones dances, they cannot be a student at the school.

Step 4: The premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" doesn't directly relate to Bonnie's situation, so we can set it aside for now.

Step 5:  The premise "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members" tells us that everyone in the club falls into one of these two categories.

Step 6:  The premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances" means that if someone is inactive and disinterested, they must chaperone dances.

Step 7:  Combining steps 3 and 6, we know that if someone is inactive and disinterested in the community, they cannot be a student at the school.

Step 8:  Now, let's analyze Bonnie's two possibilities from step 1:
    - If Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, AND is a student who attends the school, then she cannot be inactive and disinterested (because that would mean she chaperones dances, which contradicts the premise that chaperones are not students). Therefore, in this case, Bonnie must perform in school talent shows often.
    - If Bonnie does NOT attend and is very engaged with school events, AND is NOT a student who attends the school, then she cannot be inactive and disinterested (because that would mean she chaperones dances, which contradicts the premise that chaperones are not students). Therefore, in this case, Bonnie must perform in school talent shows often.

Step 9:  In both possible scenarios for Bonnie, she must perform in school talent shows often.

0 out of 1 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members."
Step 2:  We also know that "All people in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if someone in the club chaperones high school dances, they must be inactive and disinterested community members.
Step 4: The premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" tells us that young children and teenagers with those aspirations are students.
Step 5:  Now let's consider the conclusion. It states that if Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
Step 6:  Let's break down the possible scenarios for Bonnie:
    - **Scenario 1:** Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities AND chaperones high school dances. This contradicts our deduction in Step 3, as chaperones are inactive and disinterested, while young children/teenagers with academic aspirations are students. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.
    - **Scenario 2:** Bonnie is NOT a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities. In this case, the conclusion holds true because she must either be a student (from the premise about club members who attend school) or an inactive and disinterested member of the community (from the premise about chaperones).
Step 7: Since Scenario 1 is impossible, and Scenario 2 is consistent with the premises, the conclusion is true.

1 out of 2 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school," we know that Bonnie must fit one of two scenarios:
    - Scenario 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school.
    - Scenario 2: Bonnie does NOT attend and is very engaged with school events AND is NOT a student who attends the school.

Step 2: We need to analyze the given conditions and see if they can lead to the conclusion. The conclusion states that if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or performs in school talent shows often, then she must be both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities AND an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

Step 3: Let's examine the premises related to chaperoning and performing:
    - "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school."
    - "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances."
    - "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members."

Step 4:  We can deduce the following:
    - If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she cannot be a student who attends the school (from the first premise).
    - If Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community, she must chaperone high school dances (from the second premise).

Step 5:  Combining these, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she must be inactive and disinterested in the community.

Step 6: Now, consider the possibility that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.  From the third premise, this means she is NOT inactive and disinterested in the community. 

Step 7:  Therefore, if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or performs in school talent shows often, she cannot be both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities AND an inactive and disinterested member of the community.  

Step 8:  The conclusion states that if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, THEN she is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities AND an inactive and disinterested member of the community. This statement is false because we have shown that the two conditions cannot both be true.

Step 1: From the premise "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager," we know that James is a manager if and only if he is in the company today. 
Step 2: We also know from the premise "No managers work remotely from home."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that James is not working remotely from home.
Step 4: From the premise "If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home," we know that if an employee has lunch at home, they are not in the company.
Step 5: Since James is not working remotely from home, he does not have lunch at home.
Step 6: Therefore, James must have lunch in the company building.

2 out of 4 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today," we can infer that if an employee goes to the company building today, they must have scheduled a meeting with their customers.
Step 2: From the premise "Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers," we can infer that if an employee has lunch in the company building, they must have scheduled a meeting with their customers.
Step 3: Combining the previous two steps, we can conclude that if an employee goes to the company building today, they must have lunch in the company building.
Step 4: From the premise "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager," we can infer that if James is not a manager, he will not appear in the company today.
Step 5: From the premise "No managers work remotely from home," we can infer that if James is a manager, he will not work remotely from home.
Step 6: From the premise "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home," we can infer that if James is in another country, he must work remotely from home.
Step 7: Combining steps 4 and 5, we can conclude that if James is not a manager, he will not be in the company building today.
Step 8: Combining steps 3 and 7, we can conclude that if James is not a manager, he will not have lunch in the company building.
Step 9: Therefore, if James does not have lunch in the company building, he must not be a manager.
Step 10: Since the conclusion states "James does not have lunch in the company," and we have shown that if he does not have lunch in the company, he must not be a manager, we can conclude that the statement is true. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
2 out of 5 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager." This means if James is a manager, he will be in the company, and if he is not a manager, he will not be in the company.

Step 2: We also know that "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today." This means if an employee schedules a meeting with their customers, they will be in the company.

Step 3:  The premise "Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers" tells us that anyone having lunch in the company building must be meeting with customers.

Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that if someone has lunch in the company building, they are meeting with customers.

Step 5: The premise "Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home" means there are only two options for where an employee has lunch.

Step 6: The premise "If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home" tells us that if an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely.

Step 7: The premise "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home" tells us that anyone in other countries is working remotely.

Step 8: The premise "No managers work remotely from home" tells us that managers cannot work remotely.

Step 9: Combining steps 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, we can deduce the following:
    - If James is a manager, he is in the company building and does not work remotely.
    - If James is in other countries, he is working remotely and not a manager.
    - If James has lunch at home, he is working remotely.

Step 10: Therefore, if James is either a manager or in other countries, he cannot have lunch at home or work remotely.

Step 11:  Conversely, if James has lunch at home or works remotely, he cannot be a manager or in other countries.

Step 1: The premise states "People feel tired when they get the flu." This means that tiredness is a symptom of the flu.
Step 2: The premise also states "Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness." This means tiredness can be a symptom of Monkeypox.
Step 3:  The fact that tiredness can be a symptom of both the flu and Monkeypox does not mean that no one gets the flu. 
Step 4:  There is no information provided to suggest that the flu is nonexistent. 

Therefore, the statement "No one gets the flu" is false.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda" and "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies." 
Step 2:  Therefore, since The Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese game company, it meets the requirement of being made by a Japanese game company to be on the Top 10 list.
Step 3: We also know "If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list." and "The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies."
Step 4:  Therefore, The Legend of Zelda meets the sales requirement to be on the Top 10 list.
Step 5:  Since The Legend of Zelda satisfies both conditions (being made by a Japanese company and selling over one million copies), it must be on the Top 10 list.

Step 1: We know from the premise "A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda" that the Legend of Zelda was made by a Japanese company.
Step 2: We also know "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies".
Step 3:  The premise "If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list" tells us that if a game sells over a million copies, it's guaranteed to be on the Top 10 list.
Step 4: We are given "The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies".
Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
Step 6:  Therefore, The Legend of Zelda is made by a Japanese game company (from step 2).

10 out of 14 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda" that The Legend of Zelda was made by a Japanese game company.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies." This means that if a game is on the Top 10 list, it must have been made by a Japanese game company.
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can deduce that if The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list, it was made by a Japanese game company.
Step 4: We are also given the premise "If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list."
Step 5: The premise "The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies" tells us that The Legend of Zelda meets the condition for being on the Top 10 list.
Step 6: Therefore, The Legend of Zelda must be on the Top 10 list.
Step 7: The conclusion states that The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list. This contradicts our deduction in Step 6.

Step 1: From the premise "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither," we can deduce that Marvin is from Earth or from Mars, but not both.
Step 2:  If Marvin is from Mars, then he is an alien (from the premise "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.").
Step 3: If Marvin is not from Earth, then he is an extraterrestrial (from the premise "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.").
Step 4: Since all aliens are extraterrestrials (from the premise "All aliens are extraterrestrials"), and all extraterrestrials are not human (from the premise "No extraterrestrials are human"), Marvin cannot be a human.
Step 5: Marvin is a highly intelligent being (from the premise "Marvin is a highly intelligent being."), and all highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans (from the premise "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans."), so Marvin cannot be from Earth.
Step 6: Therefore, Marvin must be from Mars, making him an alien. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
20 out of 28 is correct!
Step 1: We know "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither." This means Marvin cannot be from both Earth and Mars, and he cannot be from neither. So, he must be from either Earth or Mars.

Step 2:  We also know "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial." This tells us if Marvin is not from Earth, he must be an alien.

Step 3:  "All aliens are extraterrestrials" means that if something is an alien, it is definitely an extraterrestrial.

Step 4:  "No extraterrestrials are human" means that if something is an extraterrestrial, it cannot be human.

Step 5:  "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans" means that if something is highly intelligent and from Earth, it must be human.

Step 6: We are given that Marvin is a highly intelligent being. 

Step 7: Combining steps 5 and 6, we can say that if Marvin is from Earth, he must be human.

Step 8: However, we know from step 4 that if Marvin is an extraterrestrial (and thus not human), he cannot be from Earth. 

Step 9:  Therefore, the only way Marvin can be both highly intelligent and not from Earth is if he is from Mars. This is because if he were from Earth, he would have to be human, contradicting the premise that no extraterrestrials are human.

Step 10: Since Marvin is either from Earth or Mars, and we've established he cannot be from Earth, he must be from Mars.

Step 11: This means the statement "Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars" is false.

20 out of 29 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial." that if Marvin is not from Earth, he must be an alien.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "No extraterrestrials are human" that if someone is an extraterrestrial, they cannot be human.
Step 3: Combining these two statements, we can conclude that if Marvin is not from Earth, he cannot be human.
Step 4: The premise "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither" tells us that Marvin's origin is limited to these two possibilities.
Step 5: Therefore, if Marvin is not from Mars, and he is not from Earth, he must be neither. 
Step 6: This contradicts the initial conclusion that if Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.

Step 1: The premise states that "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor." This means Djokovic must be one of these two.

Step 2: We are given the information "Djokovic is at the mixer."

Step 3:  The premises also state that "All Grand Slam champions at the mixer are professional tennis players," "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes," and "If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous."

Step 4:  The premises also state that "All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities," "If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid," and "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens."

Step 5:  The premises also state "Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid."

Step 6:  However, none of the premises directly state that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion. The premises only provide information about the characteristics of Grand Slam champions, Oscar-nominated actors, athletes, and celebrities at the mixer, but they do not explicitly confirm Djokovic's status as a Grand Slam champion.


Step 7: Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion. The statement is uncertain.

Step 1: We know that "If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid." This means if Djokovic is a famous athlete, the conclusion that Djokovic is well-paid is guaranteed to be true.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries" that if a design by Zaha Hadid is adored by Max, it has interesting geometries.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries" that if a building is brutalist and adored by Max, it does not have interesting geometries.
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that a design by Zaha Hadid cannot be both adored by Max and a brutalist building.
Step 4: The premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style" tells us that if Max adores a style, it must belong to one of these two designers.
Step 5: The premises "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative" and "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy" tell us that if Max adores a Kelly Wearstler style, it is both evocative and dreamy.
Step 6: The premise "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative" tells us that if a design by Max has interesting geometries and is adored by him, it must be both a brutalist building and evocative.
Step 7: However, we already know from steps 3 and 6 that a design adored by Max cannot be both a brutalist building and have interesting geometries. Therefore, this premise cannot be true.
Step 8: Since we have eliminated all possibilities for Max's adored designs to be brutalist buildings, we can conclude that the statement "A design by Max is a brutalist building" is false.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative" and "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy."
Step 2: Combining these premises, we can conclude that all of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are both evocative and dreamy.
Step 3: We also know that "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style."
Step 4:  Therefore, any design by Max that he adores must be either a Zaha Hadid style or a Kelly Wearstler style.
Step 5: Since all Kelly Wearstler styles Max adores are both evocative and dreamy, we can conclude that a design by Max is evocative and dreamy.

</answer>
30 out of 41 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style."
Step 2: We also know that "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative and dreamy."
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can deduce that if a design by Max that he adores is Kelly Wearstler's design style, then it is both evocative and dreamy.
Step 4:  The conclusion states "A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy." This means that for any design by Max that he adores, it must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 5: Since we know that all Kelly Wearstler designs adored by Max are both evocative and dreamy, they automatically satisfy the conclusion.
Step 6:  Therefore, the statement "A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy" is true.

Step 1: From the premise "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association," and the premise "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek," we can conclude that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.

Step 2: From the premise "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis," we can conclude that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are one of the most active players in major tennis.

Step 3: The premise "Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022" tells us that Coco Gauff is either a female tennis player or a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.

Step 4: The premise "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022" implies that if Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, then she must be ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal.

Step 5: Since we know all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, and Coco Gauff is either a female tennis player or a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, we can conclude that Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.

Step 6: Therefore, Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.

Step 7: The conclusion states that Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players. While we know Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis, the premises do not explicitly state that this includes Grand-Slam tournaments specifically.

30 out of 43 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek." and "All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal."
Step 2:  We also know "Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022."
Step 3: Therefore, Coco Gauff must be either a female tennis player who lost to Iga Świątek or a male tennis player who lost to Rafael Nadal.
Step 4: The premise "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022" tells us that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly, she lost to Iga Świątek (since all female players lost to her), and if she lost to Rafael Nadal, she is not male.
Step 5: Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros, she must fit one of these two scenarios. 
Step 6:  We cannot definitively conclude from the given information whether Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All cats are mammals" that if something is a cat, it is also a mammal. 
Step 2: The premise "Some pets are not mammals" tells us there exist pets that do not belong to the category of mammals.
Step 3:  It's possible for pets to be mammals (since all cats are mammals and some pets are cats), but it's also possible for pets to be non-mammals.
Step 4:  The conclusion "No pets are cats" would mean that absolutely no pet could ever be a cat.  
Step 5: Since we know some pets are not mammals, and all cats are mammals, it's not possible to definitively say that *no* pets are cats.

</answer>
33 out of 47 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season." and "James wants to have a long vacation." Therefore, James's favorite season is summer.
Step 2: We also know that "Emma's favorite season is summer."
Step 3: The premise states that "Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's."
Step 4: Since Emma's favorite season is summer and Mia's is different, Mia's favorite season cannot be summer. 
Step 5:  The problem does not state that Mia's favorite season is spring.  It only tells us it is different from Emma's. 
Step 6: Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Mia's favorite season is spring.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "All streaming services are digital media" and "No digital media are analog." Therefore, if 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be analog.
Step 3: Since "Every printed text is analog media," if 1984 is a hardcover book, it must be printed text.
Step 4:  We don't have enough information to definitively say whether 1984 is a streaming service or a hardcover book.

Step 1: We know from the premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book." This means that if 1984 is a streaming service, it must also be a printed text.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All streaming services are digital media" and "No digital media are analog".  Therefore, if 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be analog.
Step 3:  We know from the premise "Every printed text is analog media".  
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we see a contradiction. If 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be analog, but if it's a hardcover book (and thus printed text), it must be analog. 
Step 5: This contradiction means the initial premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book" must be false.
Step 6:  Since the premise linking 1984 to being a streaming service is false, we cannot conclude that 1984 is a streaming service.

Step 3: The conclusion states "No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three." This means that no member of Pappy's has starred in any show that piloted on either BBC Two or BBC Three.
Step 4: Since we know a member of Pappy's starred in a show that piloted on BBC Three, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: The premise states "Some stocks are growth stocks." This means there are at least some stocks that fall under the category of growth stocks.
Step 2: The premise "KO is a mature stock" tells us that KO belongs to the category of mature stocks. 
Step 3:  The premises do not provide any information linking growth stocks and mature stocks. 
Step 4:  Therefore, we can conclude that KO being a mature stock does not rule out the possibility of it also being a stock in general.
Step 5:  The statement "KO is a stock" is a general statement about KO's classification. Since we know KO is a mature stock, and mature stocks are a subset of stocks, it logically follows that KO must also be a stock.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund" and "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund" that mature stocks are not bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
Step 2: We also know "All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation".
Step 3: Therefore, mature stocks cannot be growth stocks.
Step 4: The premise "Some stocks are growth stocks" tells us there are stocks that are growth stocks.
Step 5: The premise "KO is a mature stock" tells us KO is a mature stock.
Step 6: Since mature stocks cannot be growth stocks, KO cannot be a growth stock.
Step 7: Therefore, the statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock" is false.
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
53 out of 72 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation."
Step 2: We also know that "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund."
Step 3: Combining these, we can say that all growth stocks are not suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 4: The premise states that "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund."
Step 5:  Since KO is a mature stock, it is suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 6:  Therefore, KO cannot be a growth stock.
Step 7:  The conclusion states that "If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile."
Step 8: Since KO is not a growth stock, the first part of the conditional statement is false.
Step 9:  Therefore, the entire conditional statement is true, regardless of whether KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation or not.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul."
Step 2: We also know that "If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34."
Step 3: Since Tom's license plate begins with the number 35, we can conclude that it does not begin with the number 34.

Step 1: From the premises, we know that "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition."
Step 2: We also know that "Hannah works in student jobs on campus."
Step 3: Therefore, according to step 1, Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
Step 4: However, the premise also states "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."
Step 5: This creates a contradiction. It's impossible for Hannah to both need to earn money and not need to earn money simultaneously.
Step 6: Because of this contradiction, the original statement "Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition" is uncertain.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Hannah is at Mary's school" that Hannah attends Mary's school.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition" that Hannah works in student jobs on campus.
Step 3:  From the premise "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition", we can deduce that Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
Step 4:  However, the premise "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition" states that if Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. This is a contradiction.
Step 5:  Therefore, the statement "Hannah is at Mary's school and she is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls" is uncertain because we have a contradiction in the premises regarding Hannah's financial situation.

57 out of 77 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition."
Step 2: We also know "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that Hannah is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
Step 4:  The premise "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters" tells us that if someone enjoys the dining hall meals, they are not picky.
Step 5: Since Hannah is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, and we know she works in student jobs on campus (and thus needs to earn money), we can conclude that she does not enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.
Step 6: Therefore, the statement "Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls" is true.

Step 3: From the premises "All cupcakes are baked sweets" and "All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes," we can deduce that all products from Baked by Melissa are baked sweets.
Step 4: Therefore, products from Baked by Melissa cannot be spicy.
Step 5: The premise "Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets" tells us that dried Thai chilies belong to one of these three categories.
Step 6: Since dried Thai chilies cannot be baked sweets (from step 4), and they must be spicy or mala hotpots, we can conclude that dried Thai chilies must be spicy or mala hotpots.
Step 7: However, the premises do not provide enough information to determine whether dried Thai chilies are specifically a mala hotpot or simply spicy.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations" that if a restaurant has a rating greater than four, it must be listed in Yelp's recommendations.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews" that if a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, it cannot have received many negative reviews.

Step 3: The conclusion states that "If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service."  This can be broken down into two parts:
    -  The rating is greater than 4: This would follow from Step 2 if the Hamden Plaza Subway store received many negative reviews, as it would then be listed in Yelp's recommendations.
    -  It does not provide take-out service: This part contradicts the premise "Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews."  If the Hamden Plaza Subway store received many negative reviews, it could not be one of these restaurants that does not provide take-out service.

Step 4:  The premise "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents" does not directly help us determine if it provides take-out service or not.

Step 5:  Therefore, the conclusion is false. The first part may be true, but the second part is false.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents" that the Hamden Plaza Subway store either has a rating greater than four or is popular among local residents.
Step 3: Since all restaurants with a rating greater than four have not received many negative reviews, if the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, then it does not receive many negative reviews.
Step 4: We also know from the premise "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four" that if the Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents, then it has a rating greater than four.
Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that regardless of whether the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four or is popular among local residents, it does not receive many negative reviews.
Step 6: Therefore, the Hamden Plaza Subway store either provides take-out service (which is not mentioned in the premises) or does not receive many negative reviews. </nl_cot>

Step 1: We know from the premise "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations." and "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews." that all restaurants with a rating greater than four have not received many negative reviews.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews."  This means there are restaurants that do not provide take-out service and have many negative reviews.

Step 3:  The premise "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents" tells us two possibilities: either the Hamden Plaza store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.

Step 4: Since all restaurants with a rating greater than four have not received many negative reviews (from Step 1), the Hamden Plaza store cannot be one of the restaurants that do not provide take-out service and have many negative reviews (from Step 2).

Step 5:  We cannot definitively conclude whether the Hamden Plaza store does or does not provide take-out service.

Step 2: We also know "Sir Digby fights his nemesis."
Step 3: From the premise "If somebody wins a fight, the person they are fighting does not win," we can deduce that if Sir Digby wins, his nemesis does not win.
Step 4: Since the good guys always win in "The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar," and Sir Digby is a good guy (premises "If a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is a good guy" and "The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is named after Sir Digby"), we can conclude that Sir Digby wins the fight.

Step 1: We know that "Cats are pets" and "Fluffy is Tom's cat," so Fluffy is a pet.
Step 2: We know that "Pets are allowed in some managed buildings." This means there are managed buildings that allow pets, but not all of them.
Step 3: We know "The Olive Garden is a managed building."  Therefore, we need to check if The Olive Garden allows pets.
Step 4: The premise "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet" tells us that if The Olive Garden allows pets, then Tom can move in with Fluffy.
Step 5:  We are not given information about whether The Olive Garden specifically allows pets. So, we cannot definitively say if Tom can move in with Fluffy there.
Step 6:  We know "The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000" and "$2000 is more than $1500."
Step 7: We know "Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500."  Since the security deposit is $2000, this condition is not met.
Step 8:  Therefore, even if The Olive Garden allowed pets, Tom would not rent an apartment there because the security deposit condition is not met.

71 out of 93 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "Pets are allowed in some managed buildings" and "The Olive Garden is a managed building." This means that it's possible for pets to be allowed at The Olive Garden.
Step 2: We also know that "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet."  So, if pets are allowed at The Olive Garden, then Tom would be allowed to move in with Fluffy.
Step 3: However, we also know that "Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500."  We need to determine if the security deposit at The Olive Garden meets this condition.
Step 4: The premises state that "The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000" and "$2000 is more than $1500."  This means the security deposit at The Olive Garden must be $2000 or more, which is not less than or equal to $1500.

Step 2: We also know that "All legal entities are created under law" and "All legal entities have legal obligations."
Step 3:  The premise states "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company." This means if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, it cannot be a private company.
Step 4: Since all companies are legal entities, and all legal entities are created under law, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a company, it must be created under law.
Step 5:  Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a company, it cannot be a private company.
Step 6:  We don't have enough information to definitively say whether the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a company or not.
Step 7:  Because we don't know if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a company, we cannot definitively say whether it has legal obligations and is a private company.

</answer>
73 out of 97 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All legal entities are created under law" and "All legal entities have legal obligations."
Step 2:  We also know "All business organizations are legal entities" and "All companies are business organizations."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that all companies are created under law and have legal obligations.
Step 4: The premise "All private companies are companies" tells us that if something is a private company, it is also a company.
Step 5: Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, it is also a company, and by extension, it is created under law and has legal obligations.
Step 6: The conclusion states that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law. 
Step 7:  Since we have already established that a private company is both created under law and has legal obligations, the conclusion is true.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating" that any animal with a backbone must reproduce this way.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All vertebrate animals have a backbone" that any vertebrate animal has a backbone.
Step 3: Therefore, any vertebrate animal reproduces by male-and-female mating.
Step 4: The premise "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" tells us that bees, as a group, do not reproduce this way.
Step 5: Since Harry is a bee, we can conclude that Harry does not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
Step 6: However, the premises do not provide any information about how queen bees reproduce specifically.
Step 7: We are only told that *all* bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating, not that *all* bees reproduce in the same way.
Step 8: Therefore, while we know Harry is a bee and does not reproduce by male-and-female mating, we cannot conclude with certainty whether Harry is a queen bee.

75 out of 99 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating" and "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating."
Step 2: Therefore, bees cannot have backbones.
Step 3:  We also know that "All vertebrate animals have a backbone."
Step 4:  Since bees don't have backbones, they cannot be vertebrates.
Step 5:  Therefore, bees must be invertebrates.
Step 6:  We are given that "Harry is a bee."
Step 7:  Since Harry is a bee, and all bees are invertebrates, Harry is an invertebrate.
Step 8:  We are also given that "All queen bees are bees."
Step 9:  Since Harry is a bee, Harry is either a queen bee or not a queen bee.
Step 10:  Combining steps 7 and 9, we can conclude that Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.

</answer>
76 out of 100 is correct!
Step 1: From the premises, we know that all animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
Step 2: We also know that all animals with backbones are vertebrates.
Step 3: Therefore, all vertebrates have backbones.
Step 4: All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating, and all vertebrate animals reproduce by male-and-female mating.
Step 5: This means that bees cannot be vertebrates.
Step 6: Since Harry is a bee, Harry cannot be a vertebrate.
Step 7: If Harry is neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry must be an invertebrate.
Step 8: Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone.
Step 9: Since Harry is not a vertebrate, the first part of the statement is false.
Step 10: Therefore, the entire statement is false.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" that Luke's situation is one of these two possibilities.
Step 2: We can analyze each possibility separately.
Step 3:  
    * If Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, then he does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings (because the premise states "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings," and he lives with strangers).
    * If Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers, then the premises do not provide any information about whether he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with siblings. 
Step 4:  Since either of the two possibilities could be true, we cannot definitively say whether Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.

</answer>
78 out of 102 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" that Luke's situation is one of these two possibilities. 
Step 2:  Let's consider the first possibility: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers.  This means he has siblings born together (from premise 1) and doesn't live at home (from premise 4).  The premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers" tells us that if someone lives at home, they can't live with strangers.  Since Luke lives with strangers, he doesn't live at home.  Therefore, the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" does not apply to Luke.  
Step 3: Now let's consider the second possibility: Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. This means he doesn't have siblings born together (from premise 2).  
Step 4: Since neither possibility leads to Luke having siblings born together, we can conclude that Luke does not have siblings who were born together.  
Step 5:  Therefore, the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they complain often about annoying siblings" does not apply to Luke.  
Step 6:  We cannot definitively say whether Luke complains often about annoying siblings or not.

78 out of 103 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" that Luke's situation is one of these two possibilities. 
Step 2: Let's consider the first possibility: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers. In this case, we can use the premises "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings" and "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" to deduce that Luke does not live with strangers. This contradicts our initial assumption, so this possibility is ruled out.
Step 3: Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. 
Step 4: We know from the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth" that if Luke has siblings born together, then he was born in a multiple birth. Since we know he is not born in a multiple birth, he cannot have siblings born together.
Step 5: Finally, the premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together" tells us that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, he must have siblings born together.  Since we know he does not have siblings born together, he cannot complain often about annoying siblings.
Step 6:  We have concluded that Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not complain often about annoying siblings.

Step 1: The premise states that "ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship."
Step 2: The premises also state that "Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship."
Step 3: We know Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources available to them.
Step 4: Therefore, Tom can prove economic hardship.
Step 5: Since Tom can prove economic hardship, ETS will provide him with financial aid.
Step 6: This means that at least one person taking the GRE test (Tom) has financial aid provided to them by ETS.
Step 7: The conclusion states "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something." This is false because we've established that at least one person taking the GRE test has financial aid.

Step 1: We know from the premise "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy." that spilling a lot of food is incompatible with being notably tidy.

Step 2: We also know "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing." This means if someone is a clumsy foodie who frequently tries new restaurants, they automatically spill a lot of food.

Step 3:  The premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy" tells us that cleanliness is a prerequisite for being notably tidy.

Step 4:  We are given "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly."  This links valuing order and spotlessness to cleanliness.

Step 5:  The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if a person's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then the person themselves does too.

Step 6:  Finally, the premise "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly" presents two possibilities for Peter's situation.

Step 7:  We need to consider both possibilities and see if they lead to Peter being notably tidy.

* **Possibility 1:** Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly.  This contradicts the first premise, which states that spilling a lot of food makes someone not notably tidy.  So, this possibility is ruled out.

* **Possibility 2:** Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.  This means he doesn't meet the condition of being cleanly, which is a prerequisite for being notably tidy (from step 3).  So, this possibility also rules out Peter being notably tidy.

Step 8: Since both possibilities lead to Peter not being notably tidy, the final answer is that Peter is not notably tidy. </nl_cot>

82 out of 108 is correct!
Step 1: From the premises, we know that "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy." and "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing."  Therefore, if Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, he cannot be notably tidy.

Step 2: We also know that "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy."  Therefore, if Peter is cleanly, he must be notably tidy.

Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we see that Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and cleanly.  

Step 4:  The premise states "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly." This means Peter must fall into one of these two categories.

Step 5:  We know from step 3 that he cannot be both a clumsy foodie (who spills a lot of food) and cleanly.  Therefore, Peter must either be a clumsy foodie who is not cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food and is not cleanly.

Step 6:  The premise "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" and "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tell us that if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter is cleanly.

Step 7:  Since Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie and cleanly (from step 3), and Peter is either a clumsy foodie who is not cleanly or a person who does not spill a lot of food and is not cleanly (from step 4), it follows that Peter's family must prioritize order and spotlessness.

Step 8:  Therefore, the conclusion "Peter is either a  clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or he is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness" is true.

82 out of 109 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly" that Peter cannot be both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly, nor can he be a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly. 
Step 2: From the premise "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy," and "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing," we can deduce that all clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are not notably tidy.
Step 3: From the premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy," we can deduce that if someone is cleanly, they are notably tidy.
Step 4: From the premise "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly," we can deduce that if someone values order and spotlessness, they are cleanly.
Step 5: From the premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness," we can deduce that if someone's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then that person values order and spotlessness.
Step 6: Combining steps 2, 3, and 4, we can deduce that a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try cannot be cleanly.
Step 7: Combining steps 5 and 6, we can deduce that a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try cannot be someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.
Step 8: Therefore, Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas." that the Picuris Mountains are located in either New Mexico or Texas.
Step 3: The premise "There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated" tells us that if a mountain range in Texas has a donated mine, then that statement is false.
Step 4: Since the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains, and the Picuris Mountains are in either New Mexico or Texas, we need to consider both possibilities.
Step 5: If the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico, then the Harding Pegmatite Mine is in New Mexico, and the premise "There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated" does not apply.
Step 6: If the Picuris Mountains are in Texas, then the premise "There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated" tells us that the Harding Pegmatite Mine cannot be in a donated mountain range in Texas. However, this doesn't mean it's not in a mountain range in New Mexico.

Step 7: Therefore, the statement "The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico" is not necessarily true. It's possible that the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico, and the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located there.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters." that if a car can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.
Step 3:  The premise "All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters" tells us that if a car is a single-seat electric car, then it is a one-seater.
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that if a car is a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a single-seat electric car.
Step 5: The premise "All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars" tells us that if a car is a Solo EV car, then it is a single-seat electric car.
Step 6: Therefore, if John's car is a Solo EV car, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 (from steps 4 and 5).
Step 7: The premise "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" tells us that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it cannot be both a Tesla Model 3 and a single-seat electric car. This means if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it must be neither a Tesla Model 3 nor a single-seat electric car.
Step 8: Combining steps 6 and 7, we see that if John's car is a Solo EV car, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 and cannot be a single-seat electric car. This satisfies the condition in step 7.
Step 9: Therefore, John's car cannot be a Solo EV car and not a Tesla Model 3.

Step 1: From the premises "All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers" and "If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters", we can conclude that all Tesla Model 3 are not one-seaters.
Step 2: From the premises "All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters" and "All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars", we can conclude that all Solo EV cars are one-seaters.
Step 3: Combining the conclusions from steps 1 and 2, we know that Tesla Model 3 are not one-seaters and Solo EV cars are one-seaters.
Step 4: The premise "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" implies that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be a Solo EV car (since Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars).
Step 5: Therefore, the only way John's car could be a Solo EV is if it is also a Tesla Model 3. However, we know from step 3 that Tesla Model 3 are not one-seaters, and from step 2 that Solo EV cars are one-seaters. This creates a contradiction.

Step 4: The premise states that "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car." This means if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be a Solo EV car (which is a single-seat electric car).
Step 5:  Therefore, John's car is either a Tesla Model 3 or not a Solo EV car. 
Step 6: Since we don't have enough information to determine if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, we cannot definitively say whether or not it is a Solo EV car. The statement "John's car is not a Solo EV" could be true, but it could also be false.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds" that Rock must be either a monkey or a bird.

Step 2: We are also given the statement "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe."  This gives us three possibilities for Rock.

Step 3:  Let's consider each possibility and see if it leads to Rock being a monkey:

   - **Possibility 1: Rock can fly.**  
      - From the premise "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings," we know that if Rock can fly, it has wings.
      -  However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether Rock is a monkey. 
   - **Possibility 2: Rock is a bird.**
      - This means Rock is not a monkey.
   - **Possibility 3: Rock cannot breathe.**
      - This doesn't tell us anything about whether Rock is a monkey.

Step 4: Since only one of the three possibilities directly rules out Rock being a monkey (Possibility 2), we cannot definitively say whether Rock is a monkey.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "Peter's birds can fly" and "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings."
Step 2: Therefore, if a pet of Peter's can fly, it must have wings.
Step 3: We also know that "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe."
Step 4:  Since Rock is Peter's pet, we can apply the logic from Step 2. If Rock can fly, then Rock has wings.
Step 5:  The premise does not state definitively whether Rock can fly or not, only that it is possible. 
Step 6:  Therefore, while it is possible that Rock has wings, we cannot be certain.

Step 1: We know from the premises "All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals" and "All monkeys are mammals" that all monkeys are animals. 
Step 2: We also know "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds". This means if Rock is a pet, it must be either a monkey or a bird.
Step 3: The premise "Peter's birds can fly" tells us that if Rock is a bird, then it can fly.
Step 4: The premise "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings" tells us that if Rock can fly, then it has wings.
Step 5: We are given "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe". This gives us three possibilities for Rock.
Step 6:  Let's analyze each possibility:
    - If Rock can fly: From steps 3 and 4, we know Rock must have wings.
    - If Rock is a bird: From step 3, we know Rock can fly, and therefore from step 4, Rock must have wings.
    - If Rock cannot breathe: This doesn't tell us anything about wings.
Step 7:  Since all three possibilities lead to Rock either having wings or not being a relevant case, we can conclude that Rock does have wings.

Step 1: We know from the premises "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony" and "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans" that anyone with a well-attended wedding makes wedding plans.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged" that anyone who makes wedding plans is engaged.

Step 3: The premise "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans" tells us that if John is engaged, he cannot invite friends or make wedding plans.

Step 4: Combining steps 1, 2, and 3, we can conclude that if John has a well-attended wedding, he cannot be engaged.

Step 5: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, he must have either a well-attended wedding or invite friends.

Step 6:  Since we know from step 4 that John cannot be engaged and have a well-attended wedding, the only way for John to have a larger family and satisfy the condition in step 5 is if he invites friends to their ceremony.

Step 7: However, we know from step 3 that if John is engaged, he cannot invite friends. This means John cannot have a larger family if he is engaged.

Step 8: Therefore, the only way for John to have a larger family is if he is not engaged.  The premises do not state whether or not John is engaged.

Step 9:  Since we do not know whether John is engaged or not, we cannot definitively say whether or not he has a larger family. The statement "John has a larger family" is uncertain.

Step 2:  We also know that "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if John is engaged, he does not make wedding plans.
Step 4: The premise "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged" tells us that if someone makes wedding plans, they must be engaged.
Step 5: Therefore, if John does not make wedding plans, he cannot be engaged.
Step 6: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, one of two things must be true: he has a well-attended wedding or he invites friends to his ceremony.
Step 7: Since we know John is not engaged (from step 5), and "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans," John cannot invite friends to his ceremony.
Step 8: Therefore, if John has a larger family, he must have a well-attended wedding.
Step 9: However, the premise "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony" contradicts this.
Step 10: This contradiction means that John cannot have both a larger family and a well-attended wedding.
Step 11:  The only way to resolve this contradiction is if John does not have a larger family.

Step 1: We know "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged." This means if someone makes wedding plans, they must be engaged.
Step 2: We also know "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans." This means if someone invites others to their ceremony, they automatically make wedding plans.
Step 3: Combining these two, we can say that if someone invites others to their ceremony, they are engaged.
Step 4: The premise "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony" tells us that if someone has a well-attended wedding, they invite others to their ceremony.
Step 5: Therefore, if someone has a well-attended wedding, they are engaged (from steps 3 and 4).
Step 6: The premise "Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families" tells us there are people with well-attended weddings who also have larger families.
Step 7: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" gives us two possibilities if John has a larger family.
Step 8:  However, the premise "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans" contradicts the earlier conclusions that anyone inviting others to their ceremony is engaged. 
Step 9: This contradiction means we cannot definitively say John is engaged. The information provided does not allow us to conclude for certain whether or not John is engaged.

Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if someone invites others to their ceremony, they must be engaged.
Step 4: The premise "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony" tells us that if someone has a well-attended wedding, they invite others to their ceremony.
Step 5:  Therefore, if someone has a well-attended wedding, they must be engaged.
Step 6: The premise "Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families" tells us there are cases where people with well-attended weddings also have larger families. However, this doesn't mean everyone with a well-attended wedding has a larger family.
Step 7: The premise "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans" tells us that if John is engaged, he does not invite friends to his ceremony or make wedding plans. This contradicts our earlier conclusions that inviting others to a ceremony implies making wedding plans and being engaged. 
Step 8: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, he must either have a well-attended wedding or invite friends to his ceremony. 
Step 9:  Since we know John cannot be engaged (from step 7), and if he has a larger family, he must either have a well-attended wedding or invite friends to his ceremony, we can conclude that John neither has a larger family nor invites others to his wedding.

Step 2: The premise also states that "Some mammals have teeth."
Step 3: The premise "Platypuses have no teeth" directly contradicts the statement that "Some mammals have teeth."
Step 4:  Since platypuses are mammals and do not have teeth, we can conclude that the statement "Platypuses are reptiles" is false.

Step 3: The conclusion states "Humans are mammals."
Step 4: While the premises provide information about platypuses and teeth, they do not directly link humans and mammals.
Step 5:  However, the premise "Platypuses are mammals" and the general knowledge that mammals are a biological classification tells us that humans, being a separate species, are likely also mammals.

Step 1: We are given that "Plungers suck," "Vacuums suck," and "Vampires suck." These statements establish a pattern where "suck" is used to describe something undesirable or negative.
Step 2: We are also given that "Space is a vacuum." This means space is a region devoid of matter.
Step 3:  The statement "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck" implies that "suck" in this context refers to the action of removing dirt or debris. 
Step 4:  Since space is not a household appliance and does not remove dirt or debris, the conclusion "Space sucks" is not directly supported by the premises. 
Step 5: The premises associate "suck" with negativity or undesirability, but the nature of space being a vacuum doesn't inherently imply it is bad or undesirable.

Therefore, the conclusion "Space sucks" is uncertain based on the given information.

96 out of 135 is correct!
Step 1: We are given that "Plungers suck," "Vacuums suck," and "Vampires suck." This implies that "to suck" is a characteristic shared by plungers, vacuums, and vampires.
Step 2: We are also given that "Space is a vacuum." This means space possesses the characteristic of being a vacuum.
Step 3: Since vacuums suck, and space is a vacuum, we can infer that space also sucks.
Step 4: However, the premises only state that plungers, vacuums, and vampires suck. They do not establish any direct connection between sucking and being a vampire.
Step 5:  Therefore, while space does suck, this does not automatically make it a vampire. The premises do not provide enough information to conclude that sucking is a defining characteristic of a vampire.

Step 4:  The premise "If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents" tells us that if a film is appropriate for people of all ages, children can watch it without guidance.
Step 5:  Therefore, if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film, it is rated General Audience and appropriate for people of all ages. Children can watch it without guidance.
Step 6:  However, the premise "If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents" tells us that if a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance.

104 out of 147 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election."
Step 2: We also know that "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that "Everyone who has United States citizenship can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election."
Step 4: The premise states "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship."
Step 5: We are also given "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship."
Step 6: Therefore, if someone is a Russian Federation official, they must not have Taiwanese citizenship, and thus they must have United States citizenship.
Step 7: The premise "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom" means that Vladimir is neither a Russian Federation official nor a manager at Gazprom.
Step 8:  Since Vladimir is neither a Russian Federation official nor a manager at Gazprom, he cannot have United States citizenship.
Step 9:  Ekaterina can either register to vote in the United States or be a Russian Federation official.
Step 10: Since Vladimir is not a Russian Federation official, Ekaterina cannot be a Russian Federation official.
Step 11:  Therefore, Ekaterina must be able to register to vote in the United States.
Step 12:  As a result, Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.
Step 13:  Since Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election, the statement "Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom" is true.

105 out of 148 is correct!
Step 1: From the premises, we know that "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election." This means if someone can register to vote, they are automatically eligible to participate.
Step 2:  We also know "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States."  
Step 3:  Combining these two, we can say that if someone has US citizenship, they can participate in the 2024 US presidential election.
Step 4:  The premise "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship" tells us someone can only have one of these two citizenships.
Step 5:  "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship" means if someone is a Russian Federation official, they cannot be Taiwanese.
Step 6:  "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom" tells us Vladimir is neither Taiwanese nor a manager at Gazprom.
Step 7:  "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" means Ekaterina's situation is one of two possibilities. 
Step 8: We need to consider both possibilities for Ekaterina and see if they lead to the conclusion being true or false.
Step 9:  **Possibility 1:** Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States. This means she likely has US citizenship (from premise 2), and therefore can participate in the 2024 US presidential election. This possibility does not support the conclusion.
Step 10: **Possibility 2:** Ekaterina is a Russian Federation official. This means she cannot be Taiwanese (from step 5). Since she is not Taiwanese, and cannot be a US citizen (from step 2), she cannot participate in the 2024 US presidential election. This possibility supports the conclusion.

Step 11:  Since at least one possibility for Ekaterina's situation leads to the conclusion being true, the final answer is (A).

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds" and "All alkanes are hydrocarbons". This means that all alkanes are also organic compounds.
Step 2: We also know "All organic compounds are chemical compounds" and "All organic compounds contain carbon".  Therefore, all alkanes are chemical compounds and contain carbon.
Step 3: The premise "No chemical compounds contain only one element" tells us that a chemical compound must have at least two different elements.
Step 4: Since alkanes are chemical compounds, they cannot contain only one element.
Step 5:  The conclusion states "The mixture contains carbon".  While we know alkanes contain carbon, we don't know if the mixture *only* contains alkanes. 
Step 6: The premise "The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither"  implies that if the mixture is a chemical compound, it cannot contain only one element.

108 out of 154 is correct!
Step 1: The premise "No chemical compounds contain only one element" tells us that if something is a chemical compound, it must contain more than one element.
Step 2: The premise "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds" and "All alkanes are hydrocarbons" imply that all alkanes are organic compounds.
Step 3: The premise "All organic compounds are chemical compounds" means that if something is an organic compound, it is also a chemical compound.
Step 4: Combining steps 1, 2, and 3, we can conclude that if something is an alkane, it is a chemical compound containing more than one element.
Step 5: The premise "The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither" means that a mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element.
Step 6: Therefore, if the mixture contains only one element, it cannot be a chemical compound.
Step 7: If the mixture contains carbon, it is an organic compound (from premise "All organic compounds contain carbon"), and hence a chemical compound (from premise "All organic compounds are chemical compounds"). 
Step 8: Since the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element, and it is either one or the other, the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and an alkane if it contains only one element or contains carbon. 
Step 9:  Thus, the statement "If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane" is true.

112 out of 161 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose." This means that if both conditions are true, the conclusion "he will compose" is also true.
Step 2: We also know that "If George will not compose, he either cannot compose or does not want to compose, or both." This is the contrapositive of the first premise.
Step 3: Combining these two steps, we can see that if George will not compose, then there must be a reason why he cannot or does not want to compose.
Step 4: However, the premises do not explicitly state that if George cannot compose, he will not want to compose, or vice versa. 
Step 5: Therefore, while it's true that if George will not compose, there must be a reason, we cannot definitively conclude that the reason is that he *cannot* compose. It could be that he simply doesn't want to.

</answer>
119 out of 170 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate." and "Severe cancers are deadly diseases." Therefore, we can conclude that severe cancers come with a low survival rate.
Step 2: We also know that "Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer," so bile duct cancer comes with a low survival rate.
Step 3:  The premise states that "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer," meaning if something is Cholangiocarcinoma, it is also bile duct cancer.
Step 4: The premise "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate" tells us that colorectal cancer cannot be both a bile duct cancer and have a low survival rate.
Step 5:  We are asked to consider the statement "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu."
Step 6:  Since we know colorectal cancer cannot be both a bile duct cancer and have a low survival rate, and bile duct cancer has a low survival rate, colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer.
Step 7: Therefore, the only way the original statement could be true is if colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma. 
Step 8: However, there is no information connecting Cholangiocarcinoma to mild flu. 
Step 9: Thus, the final statement "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu" is false.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer" that if something is Cholangiocarcinoma, it is also bile duct cancer.
Step 2: We also know "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate". This means colorectal cancer cannot be both a bile duct cancer and a disease with a low survival rate.
Step 3: From the premise "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate," we can deduce that if something has a low survival rate, it is a deadly disease.
Step 4: We are given that "Severe cancers are deadly diseases" and "Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer," so we can conclude that bile duct cancer is a deadly disease and therefore has a low survival rate.
Step 5: Since colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and a disease with a low survival rate, it cannot be a deadly disease.
Step 6: Therefore, colorectal cancer cannot be a form of Cholangiocarcinoma (because all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer, and colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer).
Step 7: The conclusion states that colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer. We have already established that colorectal cancer is not a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, and it is not a kind of bile duct cancer.
Step 8: The conclusion also states that colorectal cancer is either a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.  Since we know colorectal cancer is neither, this part of the conclusion is also false.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits" and "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits." 
Step 2:  Therefore, if someone eats salads regularly, they cannot disregard their physical well-being.
Step 3: We also know "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither."
Step 4:  If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she would eat salads regularly (premise 2). 
Step 5: If Taylor did neither, then she wouldn't be very conscious about her health and eating habits, and therefore wouldn't eat salads regularly (Step 2).
Step 6:  Therefore, the only way Taylor can eat salads regularly is if she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
Step 7: We know "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes" and "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes."  However, there is no information about Taylor's gym habits. 
Step 8:  We cannot definitively conclude whether Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes or not. 
Step 9:  Since the only way Taylor can eat salads regularly is if she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, and we don't know for sure if she did, the final answer is uncertain.

121 out of 173 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither," we know that Taylor cannot be both health-conscious and disregard her well-being.
Step 2:  We also know that "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits" and "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly."  Therefore, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she must eat salads regularly and be very conscious of her health and eating habits.
Step 3:  However, the premise also states "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits." This means if Taylor disregarded her physical well-being, she wouldn't be very conscious of her health and eating habits.
Step 4: Combining these points, we see that if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she must be very conscious of her health and eating habits.  Conversely, if she disregarded her physical well-being, she wouldn't be very conscious of her health and eating habits.  
Step 5:  The premise "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes" tells us that if someone fulfills their daily nutritional intakes, they must have grown up in a health-conscious childhood home.
Step 6:  The premise "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes" means that if someone visits the gym at least once a day, they fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Step 7:  Combining steps 5 and 6, we can conclude that if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, she must have grown up in a health-conscious childhood home.
Step 8:  Since Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home or didn't, and we've shown that visiting the gym at least once a day would necessitate growing up in a health-conscious childhood home, we can conclude that Taylor must either visit the gym at least once a day or not.

121 out of 174 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither," we know that Taylor's situation falls into one of two mutually exclusive categories. 

Step 2:  Let's analyze each category separately:
    - **Category 1: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being.**  
        - If she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she eats salads regularly (Premise 2).
        - But if she disregards her physical well-being, she is not very conscious about her health and eating habits (Premise 4). 
        - This creates a contradiction, as these two statements about Taylor are incompatible. Therefore, this category is impossible.

    - **Category 2: Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home and does not disregard her physical well-being.** 
        - Since she doesn't disregard her physical well-being, she must be very conscious about her health and eating habits (Premise 4).
        - This means she doesn't eat salads regularly (Premise 1).

Step 3:  Since Category 1 is impossible, the only remaining possibility is Category 2. This means Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home.  

Step 4:  The premises do not provide any information about Taylor's gym visits. We cannot definitively conclude whether she visits the gym at least once a day or not. 

Step 5:  Therefore, the conclusion "Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day" is partially true. We know she did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, but we have no information about her gym visits.

Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /beacon-scratch/tongzh24/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

    - Scenario 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school.
    - Scenario 2: Bonnie does not attend and is very engaged with school events AND is not a student who attends the school.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often are students who attend the school." that if someone in the club performs in school talent shows often, they must be a student who attends the school.
Step 3:  Combining these premises, we can see that if Bonnie is in Scenario 1 (attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school), then she must perform in school talent shows often.
Step 4: However, we cannot definitively say that Bonnie is in Scenario 1. The premise only states that she *either* is in Scenario 1 *or* Scenario 2. 
Step 5:  If Bonnie is in Scenario 2 (does not attend and is very engaged with school events AND is not a student who attends the school), then she cannot be a student who attends the school, and therefore cannot perform in school talent shows often (from Step 2).
Step 6:  Therefore, the conclusion "Bonnie performs in school talent shows often" is only true if Bonnie is in Scenario 1. We do not have enough information to determine if she is in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2.

1 out of 1 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events" and "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members."  Therefore, anyone in the club who is active and engaged with school events is either a performer or an inactive and disinterested member.

Step 2: We also know "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school." This means chaperones are not students.

Step 3: The premise states "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances."  This means if someone is inactive and disinterested, they must be a chaperone.

Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that inactive and disinterested members of the club cannot be students.

Step 5: The premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" tells us that young children and teenagers with academic aspirations are students.

Step 6:  Now let's consider the conclusion. It states that if Bonnie is either a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities AND chaperones high school dances, or neither of those things, then Bonnie must be either a student or an inactive and disinterested member.

Step 7:  We can break this down into two cases:
    - If Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities AND chaperones high school dances, this contradicts the premises that "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" and "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school."  Therefore, this case is impossible.
    - If Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then she cannot be a student (from step 5).  This leaves only the possibility that she is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

Step 8: Since the first case is impossible, the conclusion must be true in the second case.  

Step 9: Therefore, the final answer is (A).

2 out of 2 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school," we know that Bonnie must fit one of two scenarios:
    - Scenario 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school.
    - Scenario 2: Bonnie does not attend and is very engaged with school events AND is not a student who attends the school.

Step 2: We are given that "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events."  This means if someone is in the club and performs in talent shows often, they must fit Scenario 1.

Step 3: We are also given that "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members." This means if someone is in the club, they must fit either Scenario 2 or be an inactive and disinterested community member.

Step 4: Combining these premises, we can deduce that if Bonnie is in the club and performs in talent shows often, she must be a student who attends the school (from Step 2).

Step 5:  We are given that "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school." This means if someone is in the club and chaperones dances, they cannot be a student who attends the school.

Step 6: We are also given that "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances." This means if someone is in the club and inactive and disinterested, they must chaperone dances.

Step 7: Combining Steps 4 and 5, we know that if Bonnie performs in talent shows often, she cannot chaperone dances.

Step 8: Combining Steps 3 and 7, we know that if Bonnie is in the club and performs in talent shows often, she cannot be an inactive and disinterested community member.

Step 9:  Therefore, if Bonnie performs in talent shows often, she must be a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities (from Step 4).

Step 10:  Since Bonnie cannot be inactive and disinterested if she performs in talent shows often (Step 8), the final statement "If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community" is false.

3 out of 3 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager."
Step 2: We also know that "No managers work remotely from home." 
Step 3: From the premise "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home," we can infer that if someone is in another country, they are not a manager.
Step 4: Combining steps 1, 2, and 3, we can conclude that if James is in the company today, he is not in another country and is not working remotely from home. 
Step 5: The only way for James to be in the company building is if he is a manager.
Step 6: From the premise "Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers," we can infer that if someone has lunch in the company building, they schedule meetings with their customers.
Step 7:  The premise "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today" tells us that if someone schedules a meeting with their customers, they will be in the company building today.
Step 8:  Combining steps 5, 6, and 7, we can conclude that if James is a manager, he has lunch in the company building.
Step 9: Since James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager, and we know that if James is a manager, he has lunch in the company building, we can conclude that James has lunch in the company.

3 out of 4 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "No managers work remotely from home" that if someone is a manager, they cannot work remotely from home. 
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home" that if someone is in another country, they must work remotely from home.
Step 3: Combining these two, we can deduce that no managers are in other countries.
Step 4: The premise "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager" tells us that James is a manager if and only if he is in the company today.
Step 5: Therefore, if James is not in the company today, he cannot be a manager.
Step 6: We are given that "Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home."
Step 7:  The premise "Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers" and "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today" imply that if someone has lunch in the company building, they will be in the company building today.
Step 8:  Therefore, if James has lunch in the company building, he must be in the company building today, and consequently, he must be a manager (from Step 4).
Step 9:  This contradicts our conclusion that if James is not in the company today, he cannot be a manager.
Step 10:  Therefore, James cannot have lunch in the company building. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
3 out of 5 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager." This means if James is a manager, he will be in the company today, and if he is not a manager, he will not be in the company today.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today." This means if an employee schedules a meeting with their customers, they will be in the company building today.

Step 3:  The premise "Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers" tells us that if someone has lunch in the company building, they must schedule meetings with their customers.

Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that if someone has lunch in the company building, they will be in the company building today.

Step 5: The premise "Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home" tells us that an employee's lunch location is one of these two options.

Step 6: The premise "If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home" tells us that if an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely.

Step 7: The premise "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home" tells us that if an employee is in another country, they must be working remotely.

Step 8: The premise "No managers work remotely from home" tells us that if someone is a manager, they cannot work remotely.

Step 9: Combining steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, we can deduce that if James has lunch in the company building, he is a manager and in the company today.

Step 10: Combining steps 6, 7, and 8, we can deduce that if James has lunch at home or is in other countries, he is working remotely from home.

Step 11:  Therefore, if James is a manager, he cannot be working remotely from home.  

Step 12:  If James is in other countries, he cannot be a manager.

Step 13:  Therefore, if James is either a manager or in other countries, he cannot be working remotely from home or have lunch at home.

Step 14: The conclusion states that "If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home." This is a direct consequence of our derivation in steps 11-13.

12 out of 14 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda."
Step 2: The premise also states that "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies."
Step 3: This means if a game is on the Top 10 list, it must have been created by a Japanese game company.
Step 4: Since The Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese game company, it could be on the Top 10 list.
Step 5: The premise "If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list" tells us that selling over a million copies is a condition for being on the Top 10 list.
Step 6: The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies, so it meets this condition.
Step 7:  Therefore, The Legend of Zelda could be on the Top 10 list.
Step 8: The conclusion states that The Legend of Zelda is *not* on the Top 10 list.
Step 9: Since we have established that The Legend of Zelda *could* be on the Top 10 list, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: From the premise "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm," we know that Rockie is an animal that can be spotted near the campus and is calm.
Step 2: We also know that "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels."
Step 3: From the premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish," we know that if an animal is a squirrel spotted near the campus, it must be skittish.
Step 4: The premise "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" tells us that if something is skittish, it cannot be calm.
Step 5: Since Rockie is calm, it cannot be a squirrel (as squirrels spotted near the campus are skittish).
Step 6: Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit. 
Step 7: We are asked to determine if Rockie is a turtle. We know from the premises that Rockie is not a squirrel, and it is spotted near the campus. 
Step 8: The only other animal that can be spotted near the campus is a rabbit.
Step 9:  Therefore, Rockie is a rabbit, not a turtle.

</answer>
15 out of 18 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" and "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels" that if something can be spotted near the campus, it must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.
Step 2:  We also know from the premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" and "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" that if something is a squirrel spotted near the campus, it cannot be calm.
Step 3:  The premise states that "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm." This means Rockie cannot be a squirrel, as squirrels spotted near the campus are skittish.
Step 4: Since Rockie cannot be a squirrel, it must be a rabbit.
Step 5:  Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit, and since all rabbits spotted near the campus are cute, Rockie is cute.

</answer>
16 out of 19 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels." This means that if something can be spotted near the campus, it must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.
Step 2: We also know that "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm."
Step 3: Since Rockie is calm, and we know from the premise "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" that skittish animals are not calm, we can conclude that Rockie is not skittish.
Step 4:  Therefore, Rockie cannot be a squirrel, because all squirrels spotted near the campus are skittish.
Step 5: Since Rockie is not a squirrel and it can be spotted near the campus, it must be a rabbit.
Step 6:  Finally, we know that "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute."  
Step 7:  Therefore, Rockie is cute.
Step 8:  Since Rockie is not skittish and is cute, we can conclude that if Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish.

17 out of 20 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" and "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm". Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit.
Step 2: We also know that "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" and "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels".  Since Rockie is not a squirrel (from Step 1), it cannot be skittish.
Step 3:  Therefore, the conclusion "If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle" is false, because Rockie cannot be both cute and calm if it is a rabbit.

Step 2: From the premise "If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it," and the fact that Karen will binge-watch "Stranger Things," we can deduce that Karen will download "Stranger Things."
Step 3: The premise states that Karen does not download "Black Mirror." 
Step 4:  The premise "If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa" tells us that if Karen binge-watches a show, she will share it.
Step 5: Since Karen will binge-watch "Stranger Things" (Step 1), and the premise states she will share any show she binge-watches (Step 4), we can conclude that Karen will share "Stranger Things" with Lisa.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it" that if Karen binge-watched a show, she would download it. Since she didn't download "Black Mirror", she didn't binge-watch it.
Step 3: The premise "If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it" states that if a show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.
Step 4: Since we know Karen didn't binge-watch "Black Mirror", we can't conclude that "Black Mirror" is popular.

Step 1: From the premise "Marvin is from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither," we know that Marvin cannot be from both Earth and Mars.  
Step 2: If Marvin is not from Earth, then he is an extraterrestrial (given).  
Step 3: If Marvin is from Mars, then he is an alien (given).  
Step 4: Since Marvin cannot be from both Earth and Mars, and if he is not from Earth, he is an extraterrestrial, we can conclude that if Marvin is not from Earth, he is an alien.  
Step 5: We also know that if Marvin is from Earth, he cannot be an extraterrestrial (given).  
Step 6: Therefore, Marvin cannot be an alien if he is from Earth.  
Step 7: Combining steps 4 and 6, we can conclude that Marvin is an alien only if he is not from Earth.  
Step 8:  Since we don't know for sure whether Marvin is from Earth or not, the statement "Marvin is an alien" is uncertain.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien."  
Step 2: We also know that "No extraterrestrials are human."  
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if someone is an alien, they cannot be human.  
Step 4: The premise states that "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither."  
Step 5: This means Marvin cannot be from both Earth and Mars, as those are mutually exclusive.  
Step 6: If Marvin is from Earth, then he would be a human (from the premise "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans").  
Step 7: But, as we established in step 3, if Marvin is an alien, he cannot be human.  
Step 8:  Therefore, if Marvin is from Earth, he cannot be an alien.  
Step 9: This leaves us with the possibility that Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars.  
Step 10: The conclusion states that Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars, which aligns with our deduction in step 9.

Step 1: The premise states that "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor." This means that Djokovic, being at the mixer, must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 2: The premise "Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid" tells us that if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then he must also be well-paid. 
Step 3: We know from the premise "If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well-paid" that if Djokovic is a celebrity, he must also be well-paid.
Step 4:  The premise "All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities" tells us that if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, he must be a celebrity.
Step 5: Combining steps 2, 3, and 4, we can conclude that if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, then he is well-paid.
Step 6: The premise "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens" doesn't directly relate to whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion or not.
Step 7:  We are left with the initial premise "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor."  We need to determine if Djokovic fits into either of these categories.
Step 8:  The premises don't provide any information to directly link Djokovic to being a Grand Slam champion. 
Step 9:  Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion based on the given information.

</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (C).
</answer>
25 out of 31 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid." This means if Djokovic is an athlete and famous, he must also be well-paid.
Step 2: We also know that "All athletes at the mixer are famous."  So if Djokovic is an athlete, he is automatically famous.
Step 3:  Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that if Djokovic is an athlete, he is well-paid.
Step 4: We are given that "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens."
Step 5:  We need to determine if Djokovic is an athlete. We know that "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor."  
Step 6: We also know that "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player" and "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes."
Step 7:  Therefore, if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he is an athlete.
Step 8:  We don't have enough information to determine if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor. 
Step 9:  Since we can't definitively say Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, and we know he could be a Grand Slam champion (and thus an athlete), we can conclude that Djokovic could be well-paid and therefore potentially live in a tax haven.

Step 10: However, the premises don't state that Djokovic *is* a Grand Slam champion, only that he *could be*.  

Step 11: Therefore, while the premises allow for the possibility that Djokovic lives in a tax haven, they do not definitively state it as true.

Step 1: We know from the premise "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative." This tells us that if a design has interesting geometries and is adored by Max, then it must be both a brutalist building and evocative.

Step 2: We also know from the premises "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries" and "No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries" that a design adored by Max cannot be both a Zaha Hadid design and a brutalist building.

Step 3:  The premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style" tells us that any design adored by Max falls into one of these two categories.

Step 4:  Combining steps 1, 2, and 3, we can conclude that a design adored by Max cannot be a brutalist building.

Step 3:  We also know from the premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style."
Step 4: Therefore, if a design by Max is both evocative and dreamy, it must be a design by Kelly Wearstler that he adores.
Step 5: However, the premises do not state that there exists a design by Max that he adores and that is by Kelly Wearstler.
Step 6:  We only know that such a design *could* exist, but we lack sufficient information to confirm its existence.
Step 7:  Therefore, while it is possible for a design by Max to be both evocative and dreamy, we cannot definitively say that it is true.

The final answer is (C).
</answer>
31 out of 41 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative" and "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy" that if a design by Max that he adores is Kelly Wearstler's style, it must be both evocative and dreamy. 
Step 2: The premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style" tells us that any design Max adores falls into one of these two categories.
Step 3: We also know from the premise "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries" and "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative" that if a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, it must be both a brutalist building and evocative.
Step 4: Finally, we have the premise "No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries." This means that if a design by Max that he adores is a brutalist building, it cannot have interesting geometries. 

Step 5: Combining steps 1, 2, and 3, we can conclude that if a design by Max is Kelly Wearstler's style, it is evocative and dreamy.  If a design by Max is Zaha Hadid's style, it cannot be a brutalist building and therefore cannot be both a brutalist building and evocative. 
Step 6:  Since all designs by Max that he adores fall into one of these two categories, we can conclude that a design by Max is either evocative (if it's Kelly Wearstler's style) or dreamy (if it's Kelly Wearstler's style). 

Therefore, the final answer is (A).

Step 1: We know from the premises that "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis."
Step 2: We also know that "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association."
Step 3:  The premise states that "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek." 
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association and therefore are among the most active players in major tennis.
Step 5:  The premise "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male" tells us that there are no other categories of players at Roland Garros 2022.
Step 6:  The premise "All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal" tells us that male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 did not lose to Iga Świątek and therefore are not ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
Step 7:  Therefore, Coco Gauff, being at Roland Garros 2022, must be either a female tennis player or a male tennis player.
Step 8:  If Coco Gauff is a female tennis player, then she would be ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association and thus among the most active players in major tennis (from steps 2-4).
Step 9:  If Coco Gauff is a male tennis player, then she would have lost to Rafael Nadal (from step 6) and the premise states that "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022." This means Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Step 10:  Therefore, Coco Gauff must be a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 and is consequently among the most active players in major tennis.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association" that if someone lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022, they must be ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
Step 3:  The premise "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022" tells us that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then she cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Step 4:  We know from the premise "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male" that Coco Gauff must be either female or male.
Step 5: Combining steps 1, 2, and 3, we can deduce that if Coco Gauff is female and at Roland Garros 2022, she must have lost to Iga Świątek and is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association. This means Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Step 6:  Therefore, Coco Gauff must either be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 or she has lost to Rafael Nadal. 
Step 7: We are given that Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, so she cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 (from Step 5).
Step 8:  Therefore, Coco Gauff must have lost to Rafael Nadal.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek" and "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association."  
Step 2: This means that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.  
Step 3: We also know that "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis."  
Step 4: Therefore, all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are one of the most active players in major tennis.  
Step 5: The premise states that "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male."  
Step 6: Combining steps 1 and 4, we can conclude that all tennis players at Roland Garros 2022, regardless of gender, are one of the most active players in major tennis.  
Step 7: The premise "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022" doesn't directly contradict our previous conclusion.  
Step 8: Since all players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male, and Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, we know Coco Gauff must be either a female player or a male player.  
Step 9: If Coco Gauff is a female player, then she would be one of the most active players in major tennis (from step 4).  
Step 10: If Coco Gauff is a male player, then she would have lost to Rafael Nadal (from the premise "All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal").  
Step 11: In either case, Coco Gauff would not be both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.

Step 1: The premise states that "All cats are mammals." This means if something is a cat, it must also be a mammal.
Step 2: The premise also states that "Some pets are not mammals." This means there exist pets that do not belong to the category of mammals.
Step 3: However, the premises do not say anything about the relationship between cats and pets. 
Step 4:  It's possible that some pets are cats, and therefore mammals, while others are not.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "Emma's favorite season is summer" and "Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's."
Step 2: This means Mia's favorite season cannot be summer.
Step 3: The premises also state "All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season."
Step 4: We are given that "James wants to have a long vacation," so James' favorite season must be summer.
Step 5: Since Mia's favorite season is different from Emma's (summer) and James' favorite season is summer, Mia's favorite season cannot be summer or winter.
Step 6:  This leaves spring and fall as the possibilities for Mia's favorite season. 
Step 7: The premises do not provide any further information to determine if Mia's favorite season is spring or fall.

Step 3: We also know from the premise "All streaming services are digital media" that if something is a streaming service, it must be digital media.
Step 4:  Finally, the premise "No digital media are analog" tells us that if something is digital media, it cannot be analog.
Step 5:  Since we don't have any information about whether 1984 is a streaming service or a hardcover book, we cannot definitively say whether it is printed text. 
Step 6: The conclusion "1984 is printed text" is only true if 1984 is a hardcover book.

Step 1: The premise states that "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund."
Step 2: The premise also states that "KO is a mature stock."
Step 3: Therefore, based on these premises, we can conclude that KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 4: The conclusion states that "KO is a stock."
Step 5: Since the premises do not provide any information about whether or not KO is a stock, we cannot definitively conclude whether it is or not.

Step 1: The premise states that "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund" and "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund." 
Step 2:  The conclusion states that KO is a stock and a growth stock. 
Step 3:  We know from the premise "KO is a mature stock" that KO is a stock.
Step 4:  Since KO is a mature stock, and all mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund, we can conclude that KO is not bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation (as that would make it unsuitable for a retirement fund).
Step 5:  Therefore, KO cannot be a growth stock, as the definition of a growth stock is "bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation." 
Step 6:  So, the statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock" is false. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
56 out of 72 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation."
Step 2: We also know that "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund."
Step 3: The premise states that "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund."
Step 4: Since KO is a mature stock, it is suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 5:  Combining steps 2 and 4, we can conclude that if KO is a growth stock (and therefore bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation), it cannot be suitable for a retirement fund, which is a contradiction.
Step 6: Therefore, KO cannot be a growth stock.
Step 7: The conclusion states that if KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.
Step 8: Since we know from step 6 that KO cannot be a growth stock, the conclusion becomes "If KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile."
Step 9: This statement is true because, as established in step 2, if a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, it cannot be suitable for a retirement fund, and all stocks suitable for a retirement fund are mature stocks.

Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that "If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition."  
Step 4: The premise "People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes" tells us that Hannah must fall into one of these two categories.  
Step 5: We also know "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters."  
Step 6:  Furthermore, "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls."  
Step 7:  We are given "Hannah is at Mary's school. Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."  
Step 8:  From step 7, we can conclude that Hannah does not need to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.  
Step 9:  Since Hannah works in student jobs on campus, she must order takeout frequently in college (from step 3).  
Step 10:  Therefore, Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes (from step 4).

Step 5: From the premises, we can deduce that if Hannah works in student jobs on campus, she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
Step 6:  Since Hannah is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, we can conclude that Hannah does not work in student jobs on campus.
Step 7:  Therefore, Hannah does not fit the conditions for ordering takeout frequently or enjoying the dining hall meals and recipes.
Step 8:  The conclusion states that Hannah is either not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.  Since we have established that Hannah does not fall into either of the categories that would lead to her being a picky eater or spending a lot of time in the dining halls, the conclusion is false.

Step 2: We also know that "Fluffy is Tom's cat" and "Cats are pets." Therefore, if Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy, it means he can move in with a pet.
Step 3:  We know that "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet." This means that if a managed building allows pets, then Tom would be allowed to move in with Fluffy.
Step 4: We need to determine if The Olive Garden allows pets. The premise "Pets are allowed in some managed buildings" tells us that there are managed buildings that allow pets, but it doesn't specify if The Olive Garden is one of them.
Step 5: We know that "The Olive Garden is a managed building" and "The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000."  
Step 6: We also know that "The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more." This means the security deposit at The Olive Garden could be $2000 or more.
Step 7:  Since we don't know if The Olive Garden allows pets, we cannot definitively say whether Tom would be allowed to move in with Fluffy.  
Step 8: Even if The Olive Garden allows pets, the security deposit could be more than $1500, which would prevent Tom from renting there according to his condition. 

Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty whether Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden.

Step 1: We know that "Pets are allowed in some managed buildings" and "The Olive Garden is a managed building." This doesn't guarantee that pets are allowed at The Olive Garden specifically, but it's a possibility.
Step 2: We also know "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet."  So, if pets are allowed at The Olive Garden, then Tom could move in with Fluffy.
Step 3:  The premise "The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000" and "$2000 is more than $1500" tell us the rent at The Olive Garden is more than $1500.
Step 4: The premise "A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building" and "The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more" tell us the security deposit at The Olive Garden is at least $2000.
Step 5: The premise "Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500" tells us Tom won't rent an apartment if either of those conditions are not met.

Step 6: Since the security deposit is $2000, which is more than $1500, and we don't know for sure if pets are allowed at The Olive Garden, we cannot definitively say Tom will rent an apartment there with Fluffy.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All legal entities are created under law" and "All legal entities have legal obligations."  
Step 2: We also know "All business organizations are legal entities."  
Step 3: This means that if something is a business organization, it must also be created under law and have legal obligations.  
Step 4:  "All companies are business organizations," so if something is a company, it must also be a business organization.  
Step 5:  "All private companies are companies," so if something is a private company, it must also be a company.  
Step 6:  Therefore, if something is a private company, it must be a business organization, which means it must be created under law and have legal obligations.  
Step 7: The conclusion states "If the Harvard Weekly Book club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law."  
Step 8:  Since we have established that if something is a private company, it must have legal obligations and be created under law, the conclusion is true.

Step 1: The premise states that "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating." 
Step 2: The premise also states that "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating."
Step 3:  Combining these, we can infer that no animals with backbones are bees.
Step 4: The premise "All vertebrate animals have a backbone" means that vertebrates are a subset of animals with backbones.
Step 5: Therefore, no vertebrate animals can be bees.
Step 6: The conclusion states that Harry is a queen bee, but we don't know if Harry is a vertebrate or not.
Step 7: We can't definitively say that Harry is a queen bee because the premises don't provide enough information to link Harry's species to queen bees.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating" and "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" that animals with backbones cannot be bees.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All vertebrate animals have a backbone" that vertebrates are animals with backbones.
Step 3: Therefore, vertebrates cannot be bees.
Step 4: We are given that Harry is a bee.
Step 5: Since Harry is a bee and vertebrates cannot be bees, Harry cannot be a vertebrate.
Step 6: We know from the premise "Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates" that if Harry is not a vertebrate, then he must be an invertebrate.
Step 7: We also know from the premise "All queen bees are bees" that if Harry is a bee, then he could be a queen bee.

80 out of 100 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating" and "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating." 
Step 2:  Therefore, if Harry is an animal with a backbone, he cannot be a bee.
Step 3:  We also know that "All vertebrate animals have a backbone." So, if Harry is a vertebrate, he must have a backbone.
Step 4:  Combining steps 2 and 3, if Harry is a vertebrate, he cannot be a bee.
Step 5:  The premise "All queen bees are bees" tells us that if Harry is a queen bee, he must be a bee.
Step 6:  Therefore, if Harry is both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, he cannot be a bee (from steps 2 and 3).
Step 7:  If Harry is not a bee, and we know from the first premise that animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates, then Harry must be an invertebrate.
Step 8:  Therefore, if Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, he cannot be an invertebrate.
Step 9:  The conclusion states that Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee. 
Step 10: Since we have established in step 8 that Harry cannot be an invertebrate, and we know from step 6 that he cannot be a queen bee if he is a vertebrate, the conclusion is true.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings."
Step 2: We also know that "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth."
Step 3: Combining these, we can say that if people have siblings who were born together, they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with them.
Step 4: The premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together" tells us that if someone complains a lot about annoying siblings, they must have siblings born together.
Step 5:  However, none of the premises state that Luke complains often about annoying siblings.
Step 6: The premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" tells us that if someone spends a lot of time with their siblings, they often live at home.
Step 7: The premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers" tells us that if someone lives at home, they don't live with strangers.
Step 8: The final premise states that "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers." This means Luke cannot be both born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, nor can he not be born in a multiple birth and not live with strangers.
Step 9:  Therefore, we can conclude that Luke is either born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
Step 10:  Since we cannot definitively say whether Luke is born in a multiple birth or not, we cannot definitively say whether he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.

81 out of 102 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" that Luke's situation must fall into one of these two scenarios.
Step 2:  We also know from the premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers." that if someone lives at home, they cannot live with strangers.
Step 3: The premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" tells us that if someone spends a lot of time with their siblings, they likely live at home.
Step 4:  Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that if someone spends a lot of time with their siblings, they cannot live with strangers.
Step 5:  The premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings" tells us that people born in multiple births spend a lot of time with their siblings.
Step 6:  Therefore, if Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth, he cannot live with strangers. 
Step 7:  This means Luke must be in the second scenario from step 1, where he is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
Step 8:  The premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they have siblings."  is always true.
Step 9:  Since Luke is not born in a multiple birth, he cannot have siblings born together.
Step 10:  Therefore, Luke does not have siblings who were born together.
Step 11:  The premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together" tells us that if someone complains about annoying siblings, they must have siblings born together.
Step 12: Since Luke does not have siblings born together, he cannot complain often about annoying siblings.

</answer>
82 out of 103 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" that Luke's situation falls into one of these two categories. 

Step 2:  Let's analyze each category separately:
    - If Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, then he must spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings (from the first premise). This would mean he also often lives at home (from the fifth premise). But this contradicts the premise that he lives with strangers. So, this category is not possible.
    - If Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers, then he cannot have siblings who were born together (from the second premise). This means he cannot complain often about annoying siblings (from the third premise).

Step 3:  Therefore, the only possible scenario for Luke is that he is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.

Step 4:  Since he does not live with strangers, he must live with his family, which means he cannot have siblings who were born together (from the second premise).

Step 5:  As a result, Luke cannot complain often about annoying siblings (from the third premise).

Step 6:  Therefore, the conclusion "Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings" is true.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship." that if someone lives in a single-parent family or has few resources, they can prove economic hardship.
Step 3: The premises state that "Tom lives in a single-parent family" and "Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them." 
Step 4: Therefore, Tom can prove economic hardship based on steps 2 and 3.
Step 5:  Since Tom can prove economic hardship, and ETS provides financial aid to those who can prove it (step 1), we can conclude that ETS provides financial aid to Tom.

Step 3: From the premises, we know that Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources available to them.
Step 4: Therefore, Tom can prove economic hardship.
Step 5:  Since Tom can prove economic hardship, ETS will provide him with financial aid.
Step 6: This means that at least one person taking the GRE test (Tom) has financial aid provided to them by ETS.
Step 7:  The conclusion states that "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something." This is false because we have established that Tom, at least, has financial aid provided to him by ETS.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy." This means if someone spills a lot of food, they cannot be notably tidy.
Step 2: We also know "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing."  
Step 3:  We are not given any information about Peter being a clumsy foodie or his dining habits. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing.
Step 4: The premise states that "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy." This means if someone is cleanly, they are definitely notably tidy.
Step 5: We also know "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly."  
Step 6: The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if someone's family values order and spotlessness, then that person also values order and spotlessness.
Step 7: We are not given any information about Peter's family or his personal values. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Peter values order and spotlessness, and consequently, we cannot conclude that he is cleanly.
Step 8: The final premise states that "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly." 
Step 9: Since we cannot definitively say that Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing or is cleanly, we cannot apply the premises to reach a conclusion about Peter's tidiness. 

Therefore, the final answer is (C).

Step 2: We also know "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing."
Step 3: This means that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently, they are not notably tidy.
Step 4: The premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy" tells us that if someone is cleanly, they are notably tidy.
Step 5:  We are given that Peter is either "a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly" or "a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly."
Step 6:  Let's consider each possibility for Peter:
    - If Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, he cannot be both (from steps 1 and 4). This is a contradiction, so this possibility is false.
    - If Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly, he is not notably tidy (from step 5).
Step 7:  The premise "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" tells us that if someone values order and spotlessness, they are cleanly.
Step 8: The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if someone's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then that person values order and spotlessness.
Step 9:  Therefore, if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter is cleanly (from steps 7 and 8).
Step 10:  This means Peter must either be a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently (from step 3) or have a family that prioritizes order and spotlessness (from step 9).

Step 1: We know from the premise "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy." that if someone spills a lot of food, they cannot be notably tidy.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing." that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently, they will spill a lot of food.
Step 3: Combining these, we can conclude that clumsy foodies who go out frequently cannot be notably tidy.
Step 4: The premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy" tells us that if someone is cleanly, they must be notably tidy.
Step 5: The premise "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" tells us that if someone values order and spotlessness, they must be cleanly.
Step 6: Combining steps 4 and 5, we can conclude that if someone values order and spotlessness, they must be notably tidy.
Step 7: The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if someone's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then that person also values it.
Step 8: Combining steps 6 and 7, we can conclude that if someone's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, they must be notably tidy.
Step 9: The premise "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly" tells us the only two possibilities for Peter.
Step 10: If Peter spills a lot of food, he cannot be cleanly (from step 1), so he must not be notably tidy (from step 1).
Step 11: If Peter does not spill a lot of food, he must not be cleanly (from step 9), so he cannot be notably tidy (from step 4).
Step 12: Therefore, Peter cannot be notably tidy in either scenario.
Step 13: We know from step 8 that if someone is notably tidy, their family must prioritize order and spotlessness.
Step 14: Since Peter cannot be notably tidy, his family cannot prioritize order and spotlessness.
Step 15: This means Peter is neither a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All fir trees are evergreens" that if something is a fir tree, it is also an evergreen.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Some objects of worship are fir trees" that there exist at least some things that are both fir trees and objects of worship.
Step 3: Since all fir trees are evergreens, this means there must be at least some evergreens that are also objects of worship.
Step 4: However, the premises do not say that *all* evergreens are objects of worship. 
Step 5: It's possible that there are evergreens that are not objects of worship.

Step 2: We also know "Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains."
Step 3: The premise "There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines that have been donated" tells us that if a mountain range is in Texas, it cannot have a donated mine.
Step 4: The premise "The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated" tells us that the Harding Pegmatite Mine, which is in the Picuris Mountains, has been donated.
Step 5:  Since the Harding Pegmatite Mine is in the Picuris Mountains and has been donated, and we know no mountain ranges in Texas can have donated mines, we can conclude that the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas.
Step 6:  Therefore, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico.

89 out of 113 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas."
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains." This tells us the Picuris Mountains exist.
Step 3: The premise "The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated" tells us the mine is in the Picuris Mountains.
Step 4: The premise "There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated" is crucial.  Since the Picuris Mountains could be in Texas, we need to consider this.
Step 5: If the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, the Harding Pegmatite Mine would be in a mountain range in Texas. But the final premise states there are no donated mines in Texas mountain ranges. 
Step 6: Therefore, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas.
Step 7: This leaves us with the conclusion that the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico.
Step 8: Since the Harding Pegmatite Mine is in the Picuris Mountains, and the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico, the Harding Pegmatite Mine must be in New Mexico.
Step 9: The conclusion states the mine is *not* located in a mountain range in New Mexico, which is directly contradicted by our derivation.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting."
Step 2: We also know that "Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class."
Step 3: The premise states "If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z."
Step 4: We are given that "Peter is a man who is taller than Michael." 
Step 5:  Combining steps 2 and 4, we can conclude that Peter is taller than everyone else in Michael's class.
Step 6:  We are also told that "Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting."
Step 7:  The premise states "Michael cannot block Windy's shooting."
Step 8:  Therefore, Windy must jump when shooting.
Step 9: The final premise states "Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter."
Step 10: Since Windy jumps when shooting, we know Windy is a great shooter.
Step 11: However, none of the premises provide information about Peter's ability to block great shooters.
Step 12:  Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Peter can block Windy's shooting.

Step 1: The premise states that "Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin."
Step 2: The premise also states that "Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island."
Step 3: We are given that "Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands."
Step 4:  We are also told that "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands."
Step 5:  Using the rule "If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C," we can conclude that Snow Island is located in Antarctica.
Step 6:  Since Barutin Cove is on Snow Island, and Snow Island is in Antarctica, we can conclude that Barutin Cove is in Antarctica.
Step 7: However, the premise only states that Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin, not all islands in Antarctica.
Step 8:  Therefore, the statement "Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica" is false.

94 out of 119 is correct!
Step 1: From the premises, we know that Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
Step 2: We also know that Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
Step 3:  The premise states that "If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C."
Step 4: Applying this rule to our knowledge, we can deduce that since Snow Island is in the South Shetland Islands, and Barutin Cove is on Snow Island, then Barutin Cove is in the South Shetland Islands.
Step 5:  Finally, we are given that Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands.
Step 6: Therefore, Barutin Cove is located in the South Shetland Islands, and since the South Shetland Islands are a part of Antarctica, Barutin Cove is located in Antarctica.

Step 1: The premise states "Some affection is love." This means there are instances where something can be categorized as both affection and love.
Step 2: The premise also states "Some love is positive." This means there are instances where something can be categorized as both love and positive.
Step 3:  Since there's overlap between "affection" and "love," and "love" and "positive," it logically follows that there must be instances where something is both "affection" and "positive."

Step 1: The premise states that "If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters." This means if a car can carry more than one person, it cannot be a one-seater.
Step 2: The premise also states that "All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers." This implies that Tesla Model 3s are not one-seaters.
Step 3:  The premise "All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters" means that if a car is a single-seat electric car, it must be a one-seater.
Step 4: The premise "All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars" means that if a car is a Solo EV, it is also a single-seat electric car.
Step 5: Combining steps 2, 3, and 4, we can conclude that Tesla Model 3s cannot be single-seat electric cars.
Step 6: The premise "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" means that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it must be something else entirely (not a Tesla Model 3 and not a single-seat electric car).
Step 7:  Since Tesla Model 3s are not single-seat electric cars, the only way for John's car to be "not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" is if it is neither of those things.
Step 8: This means John's car must be a Tesla Model 3.

Step 4:  Since we know Tesla Model 3 are not one-seaters and single-seat electric cars are one-seaters, the only way for John's car to be neither a Tesla Model 3 nor a single-seat electric car is if it's not an electric car at all.
Step 5:  The premises do not provide any information about what type of car John's car is if it's not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.

</answer>
95 out of 123 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers" and "If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters" that all Tesla Model 3 are not one-seaters.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters" that all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.

Step 3:  Combining these two premises, we can say that Tesla Model 3 and single-seat electric cars are different categories.

Step 4: The premise "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" means that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it must belong to a category outside of both Tesla Model 3 and single-seat electric cars.

Step 5: Since the only two categories we have established are Tesla Model 3 and single-seat electric cars, if John's car is not in either of those categories, it must be something else entirely.

Step 6: The premise "All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars" tells us that Solo EV cars are a subset of single-seat electric cars.

Step 7: Therefore, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car, it cannot be a Solo EV car.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds" that Rock must be either a monkey or a bird.
Step 2: We are also given "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe." This tells us that Rock's flying status, bird status, and breathing status are all related.
Step 3:  We know from the premises "Peter's birds can fly" and "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings" that if a pet is a bird, it can fly, and if it can fly, it has wings. 
Step 4:  We also know "All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals" and "All monkeys are mammals". This means if a pet is a monkey, it is also an animal.
Step 5: The premise "All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe" tells us that if a pet is an animal, it can breathe.
Step 6:  Combining steps 1, 2, 3, and 5, we can deduce that if Rock is a bird, it can fly and breathe. If Rock is a monkey, it is an animal and can breathe.
Step 7:  Since Rock cannot be both a bird and a monkey (from step 1), and it can breathe (from step 6), Rock must be a monkey.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Peter's birds can fly" that if something is a bird and belongs to Peter's pets, then it can fly.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings" that if something is Peter's pet and can fly, then it has wings.
Step 3: The premise "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe" tells us that Rock can fly, is a bird, or cannot breathe.
Step 4:  Since Rock is either a bird or a monkey (from the premise "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds"), and we know that Peter's birds can fly, if Rock is a bird, then Rock can fly.
Step 5: If Rock can fly, then by steps 1 and 2, Rock has wings.
Step 6: Therefore, if Rock is a bird, then Rock has wings.
Step 7:  The premise "All monkeys are mammals" and "All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals" tell us that if Rock is a monkey, then Rock is an animal.
Step 8:  The premise "All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe" tells us that if Rock is an animal and Peter's pet, then Rock can breathe.
Step 9: The premise "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe" tells us that Rock cannot breathe.
Step 10:  Since Rock cannot breathe, and Rock cannot be a monkey (from step 8), Rock must be a bird.
Step 11:  Therefore, Rock has wings (from step 5).

Step 2: We also know from the premise "Peter's birds can fly" that all of Peter's birds can fly.
Step 3:  We are given that Rock is either a bird or a monkey.
Step 4: If Rock is a bird, then it can fly, and therefore, it must have wings (from steps 1 and 2).
Step 5: If Rock is a monkey, then it is a mammal, and all mammals are animals (from the premises).
Step 6: All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe (from the premises).
Step 7: We are given that Rock can fly, or it is a bird, or it cannot breathe.
Step 8: Since Rock can fly (from step 7), and we know that flying pets have wings (from step 1), we can conclude that Rock has wings.

Step 1: From the premise "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans," we know that if John is engaged, then he cannot invite friends and make wedding plans.
Step 2: The premise "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans" tells us that if someone invites others to their ceremony, they must also make wedding plans.
Step 3:  Combining these, we can deduce that if John is engaged, he cannot make wedding plans, and therefore cannot invite friends to his ceremony.
Step 4: The premise "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony" tells us that if someone has a well-attended wedding, they must invite others to their ceremony.
Step 5:  The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, one of two things must be true: he has a well-attended wedding or he invites friends to his ceremony.
Step 6: We already know from steps 1 and 2 that if John is engaged, he cannot invite friends and make wedding plans. 
Step 7:  Therefore, if John has a larger family and is engaged, he cannot have a well-attended wedding (because he couldn't invite friends to it) and he cannot invite friends to his ceremony (from step 1).
Step 8: This contradicts the premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony."
Step 9:  Therefore, John cannot have both a larger family and be engaged.

99 out of 129 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans." This means if John is engaged, the following two statements must be true:
    - John does not invite friends to their ceremony.
    - John does not make wedding plans.

Step 2: We also know that "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans."  Therefore, if John invites friends to their ceremony, then John must make wedding plans. 

Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that if John is engaged, then John cannot invite friends to their ceremony and cannot make wedding plans.

Step 4: The premise "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony" tells us that if someone has a well-attended wedding, they must invite others to their ceremony.

Step 5: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, then one of two things must be true:
    - John has a well-attended wedding.
    - John invites friends to their ceremony.

Step 6:  Combining steps 4 and 5, we can conclude that if John has a larger family, then John must invite others to their ceremony.

Step 7:  We know from step 2 that if John invites friends to their ceremony, then John must make wedding plans.

Step 8: Therefore, if John has a larger family, then John must make wedding plans.

Step 9:  The premise "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged" tells us that if someone makes wedding plans, then they must be engaged.

Step 10:  Combining steps 8 and 9, we can conclude that if John has a larger family, then John must be engaged.

100 out of 130 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans." This means if John is engaged, he can't do both of those things.
Step 2: We also know that "All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans." So, if John invites others to his ceremony, he must make wedding plans.
Step 3: Combining these, if John is engaged, he can't invite others to his ceremony and make wedding plans.
Step 4: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, at least one of those two things must be true.
Step 5:  We know that "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony."  So, if John has a well-attended wedding, he must invite others to his ceremony.
Step 6:  Therefore, if John has a larger family, he must either have a well-attended wedding (and thus invite others) or invite friends to his ceremony (and thus make wedding plans).
Step 7:  We've established that if John is engaged, he can't invite others and make plans. 
Step 8:  If John has a larger family, he must either have a well-attended wedding or invite friends, which means he can't be engaged (from step 7).
Step 9:  Therefore, John cannot be both engaged and have a larger family.
Step 10:  If John doesn't have a larger family, he doesn't have to invite friends to his wedding (from step 4).
Step 11:  This means John can either have a larger family (and not invite friends) or not have a larger family (and not invite friends).
Step 12:  Therefore, John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding.

Step 3:  The premise "Platypuses are mammals" tells us that platypuses belong to the mammal category.
Step 4: Since platypuses are mammals, and the premise states that some mammals have teeth, we know platypuses do not fit the description of "some mammals."
Step 5:  The premises do not provide any information about whether or not platypuses are reptiles.

Step 2: The premise also states that "Space is a vacuum."
Step 3:  We know from the premises that vacuums suck.
Step 4: Therefore, if space is a vacuum, and vacuums suck, then space must also suck. 
Step 5: However, the premise "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck" introduces a new concept and doesn't directly relate to the conclusion.
Step 6: The conclusion is directly derived from the premises "Plungers suck," "Vacuums suck," and "Space is a vacuum."

<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
104 out of 135 is correct!
Step 1: We are given that "Plungers suck", "Vacuums suck", and "Vampires suck". This establishes that "suck" is a characteristic associated with plungers, vacuums, and vampires.
Step 2: We are also given that "Space is a vacuum". This means space shares the characteristic of being a vacuum.
Step 3:  The premise states that "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck." This implies that the act of "sucking" is not a defining characteristic of all household appliances.
Step 4:  The conclusion states that "Space is a vampire".  While space is a vacuum, the premises do not provide any information linking vacuums to vampires. 
Step 5: The only connection between space and vampires is through the shared characteristic of "sucking". However, this connection is indirect and does not imply that space is a vampire.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that space is a vampire based on the given premises.

Step 2: We also know that "The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms."
Step 3: The premise "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data" implies that the algorithm used for training the state-of-the-art text summarization model is supervised learning, as supervised learning requires labeled data.
Step 4: Finally, the premise "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" eliminates reinforcement learning as a possibility.
Step 5: Since the algorithm used for training the state-of-the-art text summarization model requires labeled data and is not reinforcement learning, the only remaining option is supervised learning.

107 out of 138 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning." This establishes the three main categories of machine learning.
Step 2: The premise also states that "Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data." This is a key characteristic of unsupervised learning.
Step 3: The premise "The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms" tells us that machine learning is involved in training this model.
Step 4:  The premise "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" eliminates reinforcement learning as a possibility.
Step 5:  The premise "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data"  tells us that the specific machine learning algorithm used for text summarization requires labeled data.
Step 6:  Since unsupervised learning doesn't require labeled data, and the text summarization model is trained with a machine learning algorithm that *does* require labeled data, we can conclude that the algorithm used for text summarization is not unsupervised learning.

Step 7:  Therefore, the statement "Unsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" is false. </nl_cot>

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience."
Step 2: We also know that "All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films."
Step 3: However, the conclusion states "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is rated General Audience, and we haven't established that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film.
Step 4: The premise "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages" doesn't guarantee it's rated General Audience. 
Step 5: While a film appropriate for all ages might be rated General Audience, it's not a guarantee.

Step 2: We also know that all family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
Step 3:  The premise states that if a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
Step 4:  Therefore, if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film, it is appropriate for people of all ages.
Step 5:  We are given that if a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
Step 6:  We are also given that if a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
Step 7:  Therefore, if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages, it cannot contain excessive erotic and violent content.
Step 8:  We know from the premises that all movies in the "Frozen" series are family-friendly animated films.
Step 9:  Since "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages, it cannot be in the "Frozen" series.

110 out of 141 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films" that if a movie is in the Frozen series, it is family-friendly animated.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience" that if a movie is family-friendly animated, it is rated General Audience.
Step 3: The premise "If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages" tells us that if a movie is rated General Audience, it is appropriate for all ages.
Step 4: The premise "If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents" tells us that if a movie is appropriate for all ages, children can watch it without parental guidance.
Step 5: The premise "If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents" tells us that if a movie contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without parental guidance.
Step 6: We are given that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for all ages.
Step 7: Combining steps 1-4, we can conclude that if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film, then children can watch it without parental guidance.
Step 8: Combining steps 5 and 6, we can conclude that if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for all ages, then children can watch it without parental guidance.
Step 9:  Therefore, if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for all ages, then children can watch it without parental guidance.
Step 10: This means that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" cannot contain excessive erotic and violent content, as that would contradict the conclusion that children can watch it without parental guidance.
Step 11:  We are left with the following possibilities:
    - "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film, which means it is rated General Audience and appropriate for all ages.
    - "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is neither a family-friendly animated film nor contains excessive erotic and violent content.
Step 12:  The conclusion states that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.
Step 13: Since we have established that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" cannot contain excessive erotic and violent content, the conclusion is true.

Step 1: The premise states that "Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals." 
Step 2: The premise also states that "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs."
Step 3: This means that Heck cattle were artificially selected because they were deliberately bred back.
Step 4: Therefore, some Heck cattle are artificially selected. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
112 out of 143 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs."
Step 2: This suggests that aurochs existed before the 1920s, as they were the target of the breeding program.
Step 3: The premise "Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals" tells us that there are instances where animals are bred to resemble animals that no longer exist.
Step 4:  While Heck cattle resemble aurochs, this doesn't automatically mean aurochs are extinct. It's possible that some aurochs still exist somewhere.
Step 5: We lack information to definitively state whether aurochs are extinct or not.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom" that Vladimir does not hold Taiwanese citizenship. 
Step 2:  We also know from the premise "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship" that if someone doesn't hold Taiwanese citizenship, they must hold United States citizenship. 
Step 3:  The premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election" tells us that if someone can register to vote in the US, they can participate in the election.
Step 4:  The premise "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States" tells us that if someone has US citizenship, they can register to vote.
Step 5:  Combining steps 1, 2, and 4, we can deduce that if someone doesn't hold Taiwanese citizenship, they can register to vote in the US.
Step 6:  The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" tells us that Ekaterina is either a US voter or a Russian federation official.
Step 7: Since we've established that Vladimir holds US citizenship (step 2) and can therefore register to vote (steps 4 and 5), we know Ekaterina cannot be a Russian federation official.
Step 8:  Therefore, the statement "Vladimir is a Russian federation official" is false.

113 out of 145 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship."
Step 2: The premise also states that "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship."
Step 3: Since Vladimir does not hold Taiwanese citizenship (given in the premise "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom"), he must hold United States citizenship.
Step 4:  The premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election" implies that if someone has United States citizenship, they can register to vote in the United States.
Step 5:  The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" does not provide any information about Vladimir.
Step 6:  Therefore, we cannot directly link Vladimir's citizenship to Ekaterina's status as a Russian federation official or her ability to register to vote.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election." This means if someone can register to vote, they can automatically participate in the election.

Step 2: We also know that "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States." So, if someone is a US citizen, they can register to vote.

Step 3: The premise states that "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship." This means there are only two possibilities for someone's citizenship: US or Taiwanese.

Step 4: We are given that "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship."

Step 5: We know that "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom."  This tells us Vladimir is neither a Taiwanese citizen nor a Russian Federation official.

Step 6: Since Vladimir is neither a Taiwanese citizen nor a Russian Federation official, he cannot be a US citizen (from steps 3 and 4).

Step 7:  Therefore, Vladimir cannot register to vote in the United States (from steps 2 and 6).

Step 8:  We are given that "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official."  Since we know Vladimir cannot register to vote, the statement "It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election" is true.

 86%|████████▌ | 6/7 [00:31<00:05,  5.23s/it]Step 1: The premise states "If George likes music, he wants to compose." This means if George enjoys music, he has the desire to create it.
Step 2: The premise "If George has access to a program, he can compose."  means if George has the necessary tools (a program), he is capable of composing music.
Step 3: The premise "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose."  states that if George has both the ability and the desire to compose, he will actually go ahead and do it.

Step 4:  We are given the conclusion "If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose."  

Step 5:  Combining steps 1 and 2, we can say that if George likes music and has access to a program, he both wants to compose and can compose.

Step 6:  Therefore, according to step 3, if George has both the desire and ability to compose, he will compose.

Step 7:  So, the statement "If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose" is true.

The final answer is (A).
</answer>
124 out of 161 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose." This means that the ability to compose and the desire to compose are necessary conditions for George to actually compose.
Step 2:  The conclusion states that "If George will not compose, George cannot compose." This implies that if George is not composing, then he lacks the ability to compose.
Step 3:  We need to consider the possibility that George may have the ability to compose but chooses not to (i.e., he wants to compose but doesn't). The premises do not provide information about this scenario.
Step 4:  Therefore, while the conclusion might be true in some cases, it is not guaranteed to be true in all cases.  There's a possibility that George could have the ability to compose but chooses not to, in which case the conclusion would be false.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people" and "All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows." Therefore, The Bachelor is a reality TV show.
Step 2: We also know from the premises that "If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor."  
Step 3:  This means that any show giving out roses on TV must be The Bachelor, or an episode of The Bachelor.
Step 4: We are given that "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV."  
Step 5:  Since any show giving out roses on TV must be The Bachelor, this means there must be an episode of The Bachelor airing at 8 pm on Monday.
Step 6: However, the premises do not state that *all* episodes of The Bachelor air at 8 pm on Monday. 
Step 7: Therefore, while we know there's at least one episode of The Bachelor that gives out roses on TV, we cannot definitively say that *Breaking Bad* is that episode. 
Step 8: The premises do state that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, and we know The Bachelor is a reality TV show. 
Step 9:  Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot be The Bachelor.

Step 10:  Since Breaking Bad is not The Bachelor, it cannot be an episode of The Bachelor that gives out roses on TV.

Step 2: We also know from the premises that "If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor." This means that if a show gives out roses on TV, it must be a reality TV show.
Step 3:  We are given that "Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show." 
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that Breaking Bad cannot give out roses on TV. 
Step 5:  Therefore, the statement "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm" is false because the premise "roses are given out during Breaking Bad" is already false.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "Severe cancers are deadly diseases" and "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate."
Step 2: This means that severe cancers must come with a low survival rate.
Step 3: We also know that "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate."
Step 4: Since colorectal cancer doesn't have a low survival rate, it cannot be a severe cancer. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
131 out of 170 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate." This means colorectal cancer cannot be both.
Step 2: The premise "Severe cancers are deadly diseases" and "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate" imply that if something is a severe cancer, it has a low survival rate.
Step 3: The premise "Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer" implies that bile duct cancer is a deadly disease and therefore has a low survival rate.
Step 4: The premise "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer" means that if something is Cholangiocarcinoma, it is also bile duct cancer.
Step 5:  The premise "Mild flu comes with a low survival rate" states that mild flu has a low survival rate.
Step 6:  The conclusion states "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu." 
Step 7:  Since colorectal cancer cannot be both a bile duct cancer and have a low survival rate (Step 1), and we know bile duct cancer has a low survival rate (Step 3), colorectal cancer cannot be bile duct cancer.
Step 8:  Therefore, the conclusion is false. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
131 out of 171 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate." This means colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer, and it also cannot have a low survival rate.
Step 2: From the premise "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate," we know that if something is deadly, it must have a low survival rate.
Step 3: We also know from the premises "Severe cancers are deadly diseases" and "Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer" that bile duct cancer is a deadly disease.
Step 4: Therefore, bile duct cancer must have a low survival rate.
Step 5:  Since colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer (from Step 1), and it cannot have a low survival rate (from Step 1), it cannot be a form of bile duct cancer.
Step 6: The premise "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer" means if something is Cholangiocarcinoma, it is also bile duct cancer.
Step 7:  Since colorectal cancer is not bile duct cancer (from Step 5), it cannot be Cholangiocarcinoma either.
Step 8:  The premise "Mild flu comes with a low survival rate" tells us that mild flu has a low survival rate.
Step 9:  However, the conclusion states that colorectal cancer must be a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer. We've already established that it cannot be bile duct cancer (Step 5).

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits" and "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits." This means that eating salads regularly and disregarding physical well-being are mutually exclusive states.

Step 2: We also know from the premises that "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither." This means Taylor must fall into one of two categories:
    - Category 1: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being.
    - Category 2: Taylor did neither of those things.

Step 3: Let's consider each category and its implications for eating salads regularly.
    - Category 1: If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she would, according to the premises, eat salads regularly. However, if she also disregards her physical well-being, the premise states that she is not very conscious about her health and eating habits, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, this category is not possible.
    - Category 2: If Taylor did neither, then she did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home and does not disregard her physical well-being. This means she does not fall under the condition of "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly" and therefore does not eat salads regularly.

Step 4: Since both categories lead to the conclusion that Taylor does not eat salads regularly, the final answer is (B).

132 out of 173 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits." 
Step 2: We also know "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that people who disregard their physical well-being do not eat salads regularly.
Step 4: The premise states "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly."
Step 5:  Therefore, people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes do not disregard their physical well-being.
Step 6: The premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither" means Taylor cannot be both. 
Step 7:  Since Taylor cannot grow up in a health-conscious home and disregard her physical well-being, she must not have grown up in a health-conscious home.
Step 8:  Therefore, Taylor does not eat salads regularly.
Step 9:  The premise "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes" means that if someone fulfills their daily nutritional intakes, they grew up in a health-conscious home.
Step 10: Since Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious home, she does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes.
Step 11: The premise "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes" means that if someone visits the gym daily, they fulfill their nutritional needs.
Step 12: Since Taylor does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes, she cannot visit the gym at least once a day.

133 out of 174 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither" that Taylor's situation falls into one of two mutually exclusive scenarios:
    - Scenario 1: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home AND disregards her physical well-being.
    - Scenario 2: Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she disregard her physical well-being.

Step 2:  The premise "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits" tells us that if someone disregards their physical well-being, they cannot be very conscious about their health and eating habits.

Step 3: The premise "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits" tells us that if someone eats salads regularly, they are very conscious about their health and eating habits.

Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if Taylor disregards her physical well-being, she cannot eat salads regularly.

Step 5:  The premise "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly" tells us that if someone grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, they eat salads regularly.

Step 6:  Therefore, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she must eat salads regularly.

Step 7: Combining steps 4 and 6, we can conclude that Taylor cannot be in Scenario 1 (grew up in a health-conscious childhood home AND disregards her physical well-being).

Step 8: This leaves us with Scenario 2: Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she disregard her physical well-being.

Step 9:  The premise "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes" tells us that if someone visits the gym at least once a day, they fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.

Step 10: The premise "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes" tells us that if someone fulfills their daily nutritional intakes, they grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.

Step 11:  Combining steps 9 and 10, we can conclude that if someone visits the gym at least once a day, they grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.

Step 12: Since Taylor is in Scenario 2 (neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she disregard her physical well-being), she cannot visit the gym at least once a day.

Step 3: Since we know from Step 1 that there are professional basketball players who are not American, Yuri could be one of those players. 
Step 4: Therefore, if Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri must still be a professional basketball player.

Step 1: The premise states "Events are either happy or sad." This means there are only two possibilities for an event: it is happy or it is sad.
Step 2: The premise also states "At least one event is happy." This means there exists at least one event that is classified as happy.
Step 3:  Since events can only be either happy or sad, and we know at least one event is happy, it follows that not all events can be sad. 
Step 4: Therefore, the statement "All events are sad" is false.

147 out of 193 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states "The winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer."
Step 2: The premise also states "Steinhauer participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic."
Step 3: This means Steinhauer is a participant in the tournament and is also the winner.
Step 4: The premise "One six-way tie was on the leaderboard, and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium" doesn't directly contradict the fact that Steinhauer won.
Step 5: The premise "Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic" tells us Descampe is a participant and is Belgian, but it doesn't say anything about Descampe winning.
Step 6: The premise "All people on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic" is a restatement of a previously established fact.
Step 7:  Since Steinhauer is confirmed as the winner and there's no contradictory information, the statement "Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic" is false.

148 out of 194 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "One six-way tie was on the leaderboard, and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium" that there was a six-way tie on the leaderboard, and at least one person from Belgium was part of that tie.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic" that Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard.
Step 3: Since Descampe is from Belgium and the leaderboard has a six-way tie with at least one Belgian participant, we can conclude that Descampe is in the six-way tie. </nl_cot>

148 out of 195 is correct!
Step 1: We know that "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs." This statement means that if KiKi lacks both jumping and leg attributes, it must possess at least one of the following: the terricolous attribute or the leg attribute.

Step 2: We also know "If an animal has legs, then it jumps."  This implies that if an animal is capable of jumping, it must possess legs.

Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can deduce that if KiKi has legs, it must jump.

Step 4:  The premise "Jane likes all animals that jump" tells us that if an animal can jump, Jane likes it.

Step 5:  We are given that "Jane does not like any animals that bark" and "All dogs are animals that bark."  Therefore, Jane dislikes all dogs.

Step 6: The premises do not provide any information about KiKi's relationship to dogs or its ability to bark.

Step 7:  We cannot definitively conclude whether KiKi is terricolous or not based on the given information. 

</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (C).
</answer>
149 out of 196 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "Jane does not like any animals that bark" and "All dogs are animals that bark". Therefore, Jane does not like any dogs.
Step 2: We also know that "Jane likes all animals that jump".
Step 3: The premise states "If an animal has legs, then it jumps". This means if an animal jumps, it must have legs.
Step 4: The premise "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs" means if an animal is terricolous, it must have legs.
Step 5:  The premise "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs" is a bit of a tricky one. It's saying that if KiKi doesn't jump and doesn't have legs, then it must be one of two things: terricolous or have legs. This seems contradictory, but it's a valid statement.
Step 6:  Since KiKi is an animal, and we know all dogs are animals, and Jane doesn't like any dogs, KiKi cannot be a dog.
Step 7:  We don't have enough information to definitively say whether KiKi has legs, jumps, or is terricolous.  

Step 8: Therefore, we cannot conclude that KiKi is a barking dog. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (C).
</answer>
149 out of 197 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Jane does not like any animals that bark" and "All dogs are animals that bark", we can conclude that Jane does not like dogs.
Step 2: The premise "If an animal has legs, then it jumps" tells us that if an animal has legs, it must also jump.
Step 3: The premise "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs" tells us that if an animal is terricolous, it must have legs.
Step 4: The premise "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs" is a bit of a tricky one. It essentially says that if KiKi doesn't have legs and doesn't jump, then it must be one of two things: terricolous or have legs. This seems contradictory, but it's a way of saying that if KiKi doesn't fit either of those two categories, it must fit the third.
Step 5:  Since we don't have any information about whether KiKi is terricolous or not, we can't definitively say whether it has legs or not. 
Step 6: We know that if KiKi has legs, it must jump (from Step 2).
Step 7: We also know that if KiKi is a dog, it must bark (from the first two premises).
Step 8: Therefore, if KiKi is a dog, it cannot be an animal that Jane likes (from Step 1).
Step 9:  Since KiKi is either a dog or not a dog, and we can't definitively say whether it has legs or not, the only way KiKi can be an animal that Jane likes is if it is not a dog.
Step 10: This means KiKi cannot be a dog, and since we don't know if it has legs or not, we can't definitively say if it barks or not.

Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /beacon-scratch/tongzh24/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

Step 2: This means Bonnie falls into one of two categories:  
    - Category 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, and she is a student who attends the school.  
    - Category 2: Bonnie does not attend and is not very engaged with school events, and she is not a student who attends the school.  
Step 3: We also know from the premise "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members."  
Step 4: This means that for any person in the club, one of two things must be true:  
    - They perform in school talent shows often.  
    - They are inactive and disinterested community members.  
Step 5:  We can apply this to Bonnie's two possible categories:  
    - If Bonnie is in Category 1 (attends and is engaged with school events, and is a student), the premise "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often are very engaged with school events" tells us that she must perform in school talent shows often.  
    - If Bonnie is in Category 2 (does not attend and is not engaged with school events, and is not a student), the premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances" tells us that she must be an inactive and disinterested community member.  
    - Since she is an inactive and disinterested community member, the premise "All people in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school" tells us that she cannot be a student who attends the school.  
Step 6:  Therefore, if Bonnie is in Category 2, she cannot be a student who attends the school, which contradicts the premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school."  
Step 7: This means that Bonnie cannot be in Category 2.  
Step 8: The only remaining possibility is that Bonnie is in Category 1, and therefore, she must perform in school talent shows often.

0 out of 1 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members."
Step 2: We also know "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school."
Step 3:  Combining these, we can deduce that if someone in the club is not a student who attends the school, they must be inactive and disinterested community members.
Step 4: The premise states that "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school."
Step 5:  Therefore, if someone in the club is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities, they must be a student who attends the school.
Step 6:  The conclusion states that if Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then she must be either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
Step 7: This conclusion is a combination of steps 3 and 5. If Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, she must be a student who attends the school. If she is not, she must be inactive and disinterested community members.

1 out of 2 is correct!
Step 1: From the premises, we know that "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often are students who attend the school and are very engaged with school events."
Step 2: We also know that "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if someone is in the club and performs in talent shows often, they must be a student who attends the school and is very engaged with school events.
Step 4: The premise states that "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school."
Step 5: We also know that "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances."
Step 6: Combining these, we can deduce that if someone is in the club and chaperones high school dances, they cannot be a student who attends the school.
Step 7: Since Bonnie is in the club and the premises tell us the only two options for someone in the club are to be a student who attends school and is engaged with events, or to be an inactive and disinterested community member, Bonnie must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 8: We know that if Bonnie is a student who attends school and is engaged with events, she cannot chaperone high school dances.
Step 9: Therefore, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she must be an inactive and disinterested community member.
Step 10:  The premise states that "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school."
Step 11:  Since Bonnie cannot be a student who attends school if she chaperones high school dances, and the only other option is to be an inactive and disinterested community member, Bonnie must be a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities.
Step 12:  Therefore, if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

1 out of 3 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager." This means if James is a manager, he will be in the company, and if he is not a manager, he will not be in the company.
Step 2: We also know that "All employees who have lunch in the company building schedule meetings with their customers." This means if someone has lunch in the company building, they must schedule meetings with their customers.
Step 3: The premises tell us that "Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home." This means there are only these two options for where an employee can have lunch.
Step 4: We are given that "If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home." This means if an employee chooses to have lunch at home, they are working remotely.
Step 5:  The premise states "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home." This means if someone is in another country, they must be working remotely from home.
Step 6:  We know from the premises that "No managers work remotely from home." This means if someone is a manager, they cannot be working remotely from home.
Step 7: Combining steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we can deduce that if James is in the company today, he cannot be a manager. 
Step 8:  Therefore, if James is not a manager, he cannot be working remotely from home (Step 6). 
Step 9:  This means James must have lunch in the company building (Step 3).

1 out of 4 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today," we know that if someone schedules a meeting with a customer, they will be at the company building today.
Step 2: From the premise "Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers," we know that if someone has lunch at the company building, they must have scheduled a meeting with a customer.
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can deduce that everyone who has lunch at the company building must also have scheduled a meeting with a customer.
Step 4: From the premise "Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home," we know that if someone is an employee, their lunch location must be either the company building or their home.
Step 5:  The premise "If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home" tells us that if an employee has lunch at home, they must be working remotely.
Step 6:  The premise "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home" states that if an employee is in another country, they must be working remotely from home.
Step 7:  The premise "No managers work remotely from home" tells us that managers cannot be working remotely.
Step 8:  The premise "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager" means that James will be at the company today if and only if he is a manager.
Step 9:  Since James cannot be a manager and work remotely (from step 7), and James will only be at the company if he is a manager (from step 8), we can conclude that James cannot be at the company today.
Step 10:  Since James cannot be at the company today, and the only other option for an employee's lunch location is at home (from step 4), we can conclude that James must have lunch at home.
Step 11:  Therefore, James does not have lunch in the company. </nl_cot>

Step 4: The premise "Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers" tells us that if someone has lunch in the company building, they must schedule meetings with customers.

Step 5:  Therefore, if James is a manager, he must have lunch in the company building.

Step 6: The premise "Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home" means that if someone is not having lunch in the company building, they must be having lunch at home.

Step 7:  The premise "If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home" tells us that if someone is having lunch at home, they must be working remotely from home.

Step 8:  Combining steps 5 and 7, we can conclude that if James is a manager, he cannot be working remotely from home.

Step 9: The premise "No managers work remotely from home" reinforces this conclusion.

Step 10: The final premise "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home" tells us that if someone is in another country, they must be working remotely from home.

Step 11:  Therefore, if James is in another country, he cannot be a manager (from step 9).

Step 12:  Combining steps 8 and 11, we can conclude that if James is either a manager or in another country, he cannot be working remotely from home.

Step 13:  The conclusion states that "If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home." This is a direct consequence of steps 8 and 12.

Step 14:  The contrapositive of the conclusion is "If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries." This is also true, as we established in steps 6-11.

Step 15:  Therefore, the original statement is true.

Step 2: The premise states that "Rockie can be spotted near the campus," so Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.
Step 3: The premise "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" tells us that if something is a rabbit and can be spotted near the campus, then it must be cute.
Step 4: The premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" tells us that if something is a squirrel and can be spotted near the campus, then it must be skittish.
Step 5: The premise "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" tells us that if something is skittish, it cannot also be calm.
Step 6: The premise "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm" tells us that Rockie is both visible near the campus and calm.
Step 7: Since Rockie is calm, it cannot be skittish (from Step 5).
Step 8:  Since Rockie is not skittish, it cannot be a squirrel (from Step 4).

Step 2: We are also given that "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute."  This means if Rockie is a rabbit, it must be cute.
Step 3:  The premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" tells us that if Rockie is a squirrel, it cannot be cute (since skittish and cute are opposites).
Step 4:  We are given that "If something is skittish, then it is not calm." This means if Rockie is skittish, it cannot be calm.
Step 5:  The premise "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm" tells us that Rockie cannot be skittish (from step 4).

Step 1: From the premise "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" and "Rockie can be spotted near the campus and it is calm", we can deduce that Rockie is a rabbit.
Step 2: From the premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" and "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels", we can deduce that if something is spotted near the campus, it must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.
Step 3: Since Rockie is spotted near the campus and is not a squirrel (from Step 1), Rockie must be a rabbit.
Step 4: The premise states that "If something is skittish, then it is not calm."  This means that if something is skittish, it cannot be calm at the same time.
Step 5: Since Rockie is calm (given in the premises), and we know from Step 3 that Rockie is a rabbit, we can conclude that Rockie cannot be skittish.

Step 2: From the premise "If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it", we can deduce that if Karen binge-watches "Stranger Things", she will download it.
Step 3:  However, the premise "Karen does not download 'Black Mirror'" does not directly relate to "Stranger Things".
Step 4:  Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Karen will share "Stranger Things" with Lisa based on the given information. 
Step 5:  The premise "If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa" is only relevant if Karen binge-watches the show, which we established in Step 1.

Step 3: Since Karen hasn't downloaded 'Black Mirror,' we can deduce that she hasn't binge-watched it either.
Step 4: The premise "If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it" tells us that if a show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.
Step 5:  Since Karen hasn't binge-watched 'Black Mirror,' and we know the only way she'd binge-watch it is if it were popular, we can conclude that 'Black Mirror' cannot be popular.

Step 1: From the premise "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither," we know that Marvin cannot be from both Earth and Mars, nor can he be from neither. This means Marvin must be from either Earth or Mars.

Step 2:  If Marvin is from Earth, then according to the premise "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans," Marvin would be a human.  

Step 3: The premise "No extraterrestrials are human" tells us that if someone is an extraterrestrial, they cannot be human.

Step 4: Since Marvin cannot be both human and an extraterrestrial, and we know from Step 2 that if he's from Earth, he'd be human, we can conclude that if Marvin is from Earth, he cannot be an alien.

Step 5:  The premise "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial" tells us that if Marvin is not from Earth, he must be an extraterrestrial.

Step 6:  Combining Steps 1, 2, 3, and 5, we can conclude that Marvin is an alien if and only if he is not from Earth.

Step 4: The premise "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither" means Marvin must be from one of those two states.
Step 5: If Marvin is from Earth, then he is human (from the premise "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans").
Step 6: Therefore, if Marvin is from Earth, he cannot be an extraterrestrial (from the premise "No extraterrestrials are human").
Step 7: This leaves us with the conclusion that Marvin must be from Mars.

Step 3: The premises "All Grand Slam champions at the mixer are professional tennis players" and "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes" tell us that if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, then he is also a professional tennis player and an athlete.

Step 4:  The premise "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens" doesn't directly relate to Djokovic's status as a Grand Slam champion.

Step 5:  The premise "All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities" tells us that if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, then he is a celebrity.

Step 6: The premise "If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well-paid" tells us that if Djokovic is a celebrity, then he must be well-paid.

Step 2: We also know that "All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities."
Step 3: This means that if someone is an Oscar-nominated actor at the mixer, they are well-paid.
Step 4: The premise "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens" tells us that if someone is well-paid at the mixer, they live in a tax haven.
Step 5:  Since we know Djokovic is at the mixer, and we have established the chain of reasoning that leads to "If Djokovic is a well-paid person, then Djokovic lives in a tax haven," we can conclude that if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, they must live in a tax haven.
Step 6: However, we don't know if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor.  
Step 7:  The premise "If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid" doesn't guarantee Djokovic is well-paid, only that if they are famous athletes, they are well-paid.
Step 8:  We also don't know if Djokovic is a famous athlete. 
Step 9:  Therefore, we cannot definitively say Djokovic lives in a tax haven. The conclusion "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven" is not necessarily true.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries" that if a design is Zaha Hadid's and adored by Max, it must have interesting geometries.
Step 2: We also know "No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries". This means if a design is brutalist and adored by Max, it cannot have interesting geometries.
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that a design adored by Max cannot be both Zaha Hadid's and brutalist.
Step 4: The premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style" tells us that if a design is adored by Max, it must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 5:  We are given "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative and dreamy".  This means if a design is Kelly Wearstler's and adored by Max, it is both evocative and dreamy.
Step 6:  The premise "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative" is a conditional statement. It doesn't tell us that all designs with interesting geometries are brutalist and evocative, only that if a design is both, it must be brutalist and evocative.

Step 7:  We have established that a design adored by Max cannot be both Zaha Hadid's and brutalist.  
Step 8: Therefore, a design adored by Max must be Kelly Wearstler's. 
Step 9:  Since it's Kelly Wearstler's and adored by Max, it must be both evocative and dreamy.
Step 10:  However, none of the premises provide any information about whether Kelly Wearstler's designs are brutalist or not. 

Step 11:  We cannot definitively conclude that a design by Max is a brutalist building based on the given information. </nl_cot>

Step 1: We know from the premise "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative" that if a design style is by Kelly Wearstler and adored by Max, then it must be evocative. 
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy" that if a design style is by Kelly Wearstler and adored by Max, then it must be dreamy.
Step 3:  Since a design style can't be both evocative and not evocative, and dreamy and not dreamy, we can conclude that a design style adored by Max and by Kelly Wearstler must be both evocative and dreamy.
Step 4: The conclusion states that "A design by Max is evocative and dreamy." This doesn't necessarily mean the design is by Kelly Wearstler. 
Step 5:  We need more information to definitively say whether a design by Max is evocative and dreamy. The premises only tell us about designs by Kelly Wearstler that Max adores.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative" and "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy".  
Step 2: This means that if a design by Max that he adores is a Kelly Wearstler design, it must be both evocative and dreamy.  
Step 3: We also know that "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style".  
Step 4:  Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if a design by Max is Kelly Wearstler's, it's both evocative and dreamy.  
Step 5: The premise "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries" doesn't directly tell us if these designs are evocative or dreamy.  
Step 6: The premise "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative" tells us that if a design is both interesting and adored by Max, it must be both a brutalist building and evocative.  
Step 7: However, we don't know if all of Zaha Hadid's designs that Max adores have interesting geometries, so we can't definitively say if they are all brutalist and evocative.  
Step 8: Since we can't definitively say if Zaha Hadid's designs are both evocative and dreamy, and we know Kelly Wearstler's designs are, the only guaranteed conclusion is that a design by Max is either Kelly Wearstler's (and therefore evocative and dreamy) or it's Zaha Hadid's (with uncertain characteristics).  
Step 9: Therefore, the statement "A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy" is true.

Step 2: We also know that "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association."
Step 3:  The premise states "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek."  
Step 4:  Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the WTA.
Step 5: The premise "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male" tells us that there are no other categories of tennis players at the tournament.
Step 6:  We are given that "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022." This means if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA, she cannot be a male player at Roland Garros 2022.
Step 7: Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, and we know from steps 1-6 that all players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male, Coco Gauff must be female.
Step 8:  Therefore, Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, and we know from step 4 that all female players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the WTA.
Step 9:  Finally, step 1 tells us that anyone ranked highly by the WTA is one of the most active players in major tennis.
Step 10:  Therefore, Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.

Step 2:  We also know that "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022."
Step 3:  Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, and we're considering the case where she is not a male player at Roland Garros 2022, this means Coco Gauff must be ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
Step 4:  The premise states that "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis."
Step 5: This tells us that Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.
Step 6: However, this information doesn't directly tell us if she lost to Rafael Nadal. 
Step 7: The conclusion states "Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal."  
Step 8:  We need more information to determine if this is true, false, or uncertain.

Step 1: From the premise "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis," we know that being ranked highly by the WTA is a sufficient condition for being one of the most active players in major tennis.

Step 2: From the premise "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association," we know that losing to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is a sufficient condition for being ranked highly by the WTA.

Step 3: From the premise "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek," we know that if a player is female and at Roland Garros 2022, then they lost to Iga Świątek.

Step 4: From the premise "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male," we know that any player at Roland Garros 2022 must be either female or male.

Step 5: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the WTA.

Step 6:  Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, and we know from step 5 that all female players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the WTA, Coco Gauff must be ranked highly by the WTA.

Step 7:  The premise "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022" tells us that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Nadal, then she cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.

Step 8: Since we established in step 6 that Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA, the "or" part of the premise in step 7 is true.  Therefore, Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.

Step 9:  The conclusion states that Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis. We know from steps 2 and 6 that Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA, and from step 1 that being ranked highly by the WTA is a sufficient condition for being one of the most active players in major tennis.  Therefore, Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.  We also know from step 8 that Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Since all female players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek, Coco Gauff must have lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022.  

Step 10:  Therefore, Coco Gauff is both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis. The conclusion states that she is *not* both, so the conclusion is false.

Step 4: However, the premise states that "No digital media are analog" and "All streaming services are digital media."  
Step 5: This means that if something is a streaming service, it cannot be analog.

Step 3: The premise "All languages within a language family are related to each other" tells us that if two languages are in the same family, they are related.
Step 4: We are given that "French and Spanish are both Romance languages," so French and Spanish are related to each other.
Step 5: We are also given that "German is related to Spanish." 
Step 6:  However, the premise "Basque is not related to any other language" directly contradicts the idea that Basque could be a Romance language.

Step 3:  The premise states "German is related to Spanish."
Step 4:  Since Spanish is a Romance language, and all Romance languages are Indo-European, we can conclude that German is related to an Indo-European language.
Step 5: However, the premises do not state that German is *specifically* a Romance language, only that it is related to one.  
Step 6:  We know from the premises that "Basque is not related to any other language." 
Step 7: This means Basque is a language isolate, not part of any language family.
Step 8:  Therefore, German cannot be Basque, as they are unrelated.
Step 9:  Since German is related to Spanish, and Spanish is Romance, but German is not Basque, the only remaining possibility is that German is a Germanic language.

Step 3:  Since St Pierre is not in Montana, and there are no exceptions listed for St Pierre, it must be in a different state.

Step 3:  The premise "Billings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S." and "The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula" tell us that Billings, Butte, Helena, and Missoula are all in Montana.
Step 4:  Since St Pierre is not in Montana, and all cities in Butte are not in St Pierre, we can conclude that St Pierre and Butte are not in the same state.
Step 5:  The premise "White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S." tells us that White Sulphur Springs and Butte are in the same state.
Step 6: Since Butte is not in St Pierre, and White Sulphur Springs is in the same state as Butte, we can conclude that White Sulphur Springs is not in St Pierre.
Step 7:  The premise "A city can only be in one state in U.S. except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City" tells us that each city can only be in one state, with the exception of the four cities listed.
Step 8:  Since St Pierre is not in Montana, and we have ruled out Butte and White Sulphur Springs, and the only other possible states are those where Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, and Union City are located, we can conclude that St Pierre must be in one of those states.
Step 9:  However, we don't have any information about Bismarck's location. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether St Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state.

Step 1: The premise states that "International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa."
Step 2: The premise also states that "Mike is an international student."
Step 3:  Therefore, Mike must have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
Step 4: We are given that "Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US."
Step 5:  The premise "An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US" tells us that if someone is on an F1 visa and wants to work, they must apply for CPT or OPT.
Step 6: Since Mike needs to apply for CPT to work, and we know the rule for F1 visa holders, we can infer that Mike is likely on an F1 visa.
Step 7: However, we cannot definitively say he *must* have an F1 visa. It's possible he is on a J1 visa and has a different work authorization process.

Step 3: The premise states that "Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US."
Step 4:  Since Mike is an international student and needs to apply for CPT to work in the US, we can deduce that Mike must have an F1 visa.

 43%|████▎     | 3/7 [00:16<00:22,  5.53s/it]Step 1: The premise states that "All Brown Swiss cattle are cows." This means if something is a Brown Swiss cattle, it is also a cow.
Step 2: The premise also states that "All cows are domesticated animals."  
Step 3: We are given that "Alligators are not domesticated animals."
Step 4: Since Ted is an alligator, and alligators are not domesticated animals, Ted cannot be a domesticated animal.
Step 5:  The conclusion states "If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet."  
Step 6:  We know from step 4 that Ted cannot be a domesticated animal.  
Step 7:  Since all Brown Swiss cattle are cows, and all cows are domesticated animals, if Ted were a Brown Swiss cattle, it would have to be a domesticated animal, which we know is not true.

Step 1: The premise states that "Yale university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion."
Step 2: However, this does not tell us if this is the largest endowment among all educational institutions. 
Step 3: We need more information to compare Yale's endowment to other universities to determine if it is the largest.
Step 4:  The premises only provide information about Yale University and its residential colleges, not about the endowments of other institutions. 
Step 5: Therefore, we cannot definitively say if Yale has the largest university endowment of any educational institution.

Step 1: The premise states that "Badults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three."
Step 2: The premise also states that "The Working title "The Secret Dude Society" was used for Badults."
Step 3:  Therefore, we can conclude that the series with the working title "The Secret Dude Society" is Badults.
Step 4: The premise "Andrew Collins was the script editor for Badults" tells us that Andrew Collins was the script editor for Badults. 
Step 5:  Since Badults is the series with the working title "The Secret Dude Society," we can conclude that Andrew Collins was the script editor for a series with the working title "The Secret Dude Society." </nl_cot>

Step 1: The premise states that "Badults is a British Sitcom series starring members of Pappy's." 
Step 2: The premise also states that "Badults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three."
Step 3:  We don't have any information about other shows starring members of Pappy's or their pilot channels.
Step 4:  The conclusion states "No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three."
Step 5: Since we only know about Badults, which piloted on BBC Three, we cannot definitively say that *no* members of Pappy's have starred in shows on BBC Two.
Step 6:  The conclusion is too strong of a statement based on the limited information provided.

Step 1: The premise states that "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund."
Step 2:  The premise also states that "KO is a mature stock."
Step 3: Therefore, KO must be suitable for a retirement fund. 
Step 4:  The conclusion states "KO is a stock."  This is true by definition, as all mature stocks are a type of stock. 
Step 5:  Since KO is a mature stock, and all mature stocks are stocks, KO is a stock. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
50 out of 71 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund" that if a stock is mature, it must be suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund" that if a stock is bought for rapid price appreciation, it cannot be suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 3:  We are given that KO is a mature stock, so from Step 1, we know KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 4: Since KO is suitable for a retirement fund, it cannot be bought for rapid price appreciation (from Step 2).
Step 5:  Therefore, KO cannot be a growth stock, as growth stocks are defined as those bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.

Step 6:  The conclusion states that KO is both a stock and a growth stock. Since we've established that KO cannot be a growth stock, the conclusion is false. </nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
51 out of 72 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation." This means if a stock is a growth stock, it must be bought for rapid price appreciation.
Step 2: We also know "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund." This means if a stock is bought for rapid price appreciation, it cannot be suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 3: The premise "KO is a mature stock" tells us that KO is a mature stock.
Step 4: The premise "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund" tells us that if a stock is mature, it must be suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 5:  Since KO is a mature stock, and all mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds, we can conclude that KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 6:  Since KO is suitable for a retirement fund, and we know that stocks bought for rapid price appreciation are not suitable for retirement funds, we can conclude that KO cannot be bought for rapid price appreciation.
Step 7:  Therefore, if KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, it cannot be a growth stock (as we established in Step 6).
Step 8:  Since KO cannot be a growth stock, and we know that all growth stocks are bought for rapid price appreciation, KO cannot be bought for rapid price appreciation either.
Step 9:  The conclusion states that if KO is a growth stock or bought for rapid price appreciation, then it is neither a stock nor is its price volatile. Since we have established in Steps 7 and 8 that KO cannot be a growth stock or bought for rapid price appreciation, the conclusion is true. </nl_cot>

53 out of 74 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul." 
Step 2: We also know that "If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34." 
Step 3:  Since Tom's license plate begins with the number 35, we can apply the second premise to conclude that it does not begin with the number 34.
Step 4:  Therefore, Tom's license plate cannot be from Istanbul according to the first premise.

Step 1: From the premise "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition," we know that if someone works in student jobs on campus, they need to earn money for tuition.
Step 2: We are given that "Hannah is at Mary's school and Hannah works in student jobs on campus."
Step 3: Therefore, based on step 1 and 2, we can conclude that Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

54 out of 76 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition," we know that if someone works in student jobs on campus, they must need to earn money for tuition.
Step 2: We also know "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters." This means if someone enjoys the dining hall meals, they can't be picky.
Step 3: The premise "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls" tells us that if someone enjoys the dining hall, they spend a lot of time there.
Step 4: We are given that "Hannah is at Mary's school."
Step 5: We are also given "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition." This seems like a contradiction, but it's a key piece of information.
Step 6: Since Hannah works on campus and needs to earn money (from Step 1), we can deduce that she must not be picky (from Step 5).
Step 7:  We don't have enough information to say for sure if Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes or not.  
Step 8:  Therefore, we can't definitively say if Hannah spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition."  
Step 2: We also know that "If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus."  
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if people at Mary's school order takeout frequently, they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.  
Step 4: The premise states that "People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes."  
Step 5:  Therefore, people at Mary's school either need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.  
Step 6: The premise "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters" tells us that if someone enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, they cannot be picky eaters.  
Step 7:  The premise "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls" tells us that if someone enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, they spend a lot of time there.  
Step 8:  Combining steps 5, 6, and 7, we can deduce that if someone at Mary's school enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, they are not picky eaters and spend a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the dining halls.  
Step 9: Since we know from step 5 that people at Mary's school either need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, we can conclude that all people at Mary's school either need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition or are not picky eaters and spend a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the dining halls.  
Step 10: The final statement "Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls" is a restatement of the conclusion we derived in step 9.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All cupcakes are baked sweets" and "No baked sweets are spicy." This means that being a baked sweet is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being a cupcake. 
Step 2:  We also know that "All mala hotpots are spicy."  
Step 3: The premise states that "Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets." This means there are three possibilities for dried Thai chilies: 
    - They are spicy.
    - They are mala hotpots.
    - They are not baked sweets.
Step 4: Since we know that all cupcakes are baked sweets, and no baked sweets are spicy, we can deduce that if something is a cupcake, it cannot be spicy.  
Step 5:  Therefore, if dried Thai chilies were cupcakes, they could not be spicy. But we know from Step 3 that dried Thai chilies can be spicy.  
Step 6: This means dried Thai chilies cannot be cupcakes.  
Step 7:  We are left with the conclusion that dried Thai chilies are not cupcakes.

Step 4: Since cupcakes are not spicy and dried Thai chilies are either spicy or mala hotpots, dried Thai chilies cannot be a cupcake.
Step 5:  Therefore, dried Thai chilies must be either spicy or a mala hotpot.
Step 6: Since we know all mala hotpots are spicy, if dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot, they would also be spicy.

Step 3: From the premise "All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes," we know that if something is a product of Baked by Melissa, it must be a cupcake.
Step 4: From the premise "All mala hotpots are spicy," we know that if something is a mala hotpot, it must be spicy.
Step 5: The premise "Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets" tells us about the possible categories of Dried Thai chilies. It doesn't say anything about whether they are products of Baked by Melissa.

Step 7:  Therefore, if Dried Thai chilies were a cupcake, it would contradict the premises.
Step 8: Since Dried Thai chilies are either spicy or mala hotpots, and we know cupcakes cannot be spicy, Dried Thai chilies cannot be a cupcake.
Step 9:  This means Dried Thai chilies cannot be a product of Baked by Melissa, as all products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.

Step 1: The premise states "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews."  
Step 2: The premise also states "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations."  
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that all restaurants with a rating greater than four have not received many negative reviews.  
Step 4: The premise "Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews" tells us there are restaurants that don't offer take-out and have many negative reviews.  
Step 5: The premise "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four" tells us that if a restaurant is popular among local residents, its rating must be greater than four.  
Step 6:  We are given "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents." This means if the store's rating is not greater than four, it must be popular among local residents.  
Step 7: Since the store's rating is not greater than four (as the conclusion states it receives many negative reviews, and we know from Step 3 that restaurants with high ratings don't receive many negative reviews), it must be popular among local residents.  
Step 8: From Step 5, we know that popular restaurants have ratings greater than four.  
Step 9:  Therefore, the Hamden Plaza Subway store must have a rating greater than four.  
Step 10:  The conclusion states that if the store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than four and it does not provide take-out service. Since we established in Steps 8 and 9 that the store has a rating greater than four, the conclusion is true under this scenario.

59 out of 84 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews." 
Step 2: We also know that "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations."
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can infer that all restaurants with a rating greater than four have not received many negative reviews.
Step 4: The premise states that "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents." 
Step 5: Since we know that restaurants with a rating greater than four haven't received many negative reviews, we can conclude that if the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, it hasn't received many negative reviews.
Step 6:  The premise "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four" tells us that if a restaurant is popular among local residents, it must have a rating greater than four.
Step 7:  Therefore, if the Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents, it also wouldn't have received many negative reviews (as explained in Step 5).
Step 8:  We are left with the following possibilities:
    - The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four.
    - The Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents.
    - Both.
Step 9:  In either scenario, the Hamden Plaza Subway store either hasn't received many negative reviews or is popular among local residents, which means it either provides take-out service (as this is not explicitly stated as a condition for either scenario) or does not receive many negative reviews.

60 out of 85 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents," we know that either the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents, or both. 
Step 2:  From the premise "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations," we know that if a restaurant has a rating greater than four, it must be listed in Yelp's recommendations. 
Step 3:  From the premise "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews," we know that if a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, it cannot have received many negative reviews.
Step 4:  From the premise "Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews," we know that there are restaurants that do not provide take-out service and have received many negative reviews. 
Step 5: Since the Hamden Plaza Subway store cannot have received many negative reviews (from Step 3), and it must either have a rating greater than four or be popular among local residents (from Step 1), it cannot be a restaurant that does not provide take-out service and has received many negative reviews (from Step 4).
Step 6: Therefore, the Hamden Plaza Subway store must provide take-out service. 
Step 7: The conclusion states that the Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service, which contradicts our derivation in Step 6. 
Step 8:  Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: We know from the premise "In superhero movies, the good guys always win." that if a movie is a superhero movie, the good guys win.
Step 2: We also know "The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is a superhero movie."
Step 3:  Combining these, we can conclude that the good guys win in The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar.
Step 4:  The premise "Good guys fight bad guys and vice versa" tells us that if someone is fighting someone else, they are fighting against the opposite side.
Step 5:  We know "Sir Digby fights his nemesis."  This means Sir Digby is fighting a bad guy.
Step 6: Since Sir Digby is fighting a bad guy, and the good guys win in this movie, we can conclude that Sir Digby wins the fight.
Step 7:  The premise "If somebody wins a fight, the person they are fighting does not win" tells us that if one person wins, the other person loses.
Step 8:  Therefore, Sir Digby's nemesis, being the person Sir Digby fights, must lose the fight.
Step 9:  The conclusion "Sir Digby’s nemesis does not win" is true based on the logic derived in steps 6 and 7.

Step 1: The premise states that "Books contain tons of knowledge." 
Step 2: The premise also states that "When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge."
Step 3:  Therefore, by reading a book, Harry gained knowledge.
Step 4: The premise "If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter" tells us that gaining knowledge leads to increased intelligence.
Step 5: Since Harry gained knowledge from reading "Walden," we can conclude that Harry became smarter.
Step 6: The conclusion states that "Harry is smarter than before," which is a direct result of the chain of reasoning above.

Step 1: The premise states that "A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task."
Step 2: The premise also states that "If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task."
Step 3:  The premise "Machine translation is a natural language processing task" tells us that machine translation falls under the category of natural language processing.
Step 4: The premise "The output of machine translation is a text sequence" tells us that the output of machine translation is a text sequence.
Step 5: Since the output of machine translation is a text sequence, and we know from Step 2 that if the output is a text sequence, it must be a language generation task, we can conclude that machine translation is a language generation task.

Step 1: The premise states that "A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task."
Step 2: The premise also states that "If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task."
Step 3:  We are given that "The output of machine translation is a text sequence."
Step 4:  Therefore, by the second premise, we can conclude that machine translation is a language generation task.
Step 5: Since machine translation is a language generation task, and the only two categories are language generation and language understanding, machine translation cannot be a language understanding task.

Step 1: From the premises, we know that "Pets are allowed in some managed buildings" and "The Olive Garden is a managed building."  This means there's a possibility that pets are allowed in The Olive Garden.
Step 2:  We also know "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet." So, if pets are allowed at The Olive Garden, Tom can move in with Fluffy.
Step 3: The premise states "Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500." 
Step 4: We know "The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more." This means the security deposit at The Olive Garden could be $2000 (the monthly rent) or more.
Step 5:  We are given that "$2000 is more than $1500."  
Step 6:  Since the security deposit at The Olive Garden could be more than $1500, and Tom's condition for renting is that the security deposit must be no more than $1500, Tom cannot rent an apartment at The Olive Garden.

Step 2: We also know "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet".  
Step 3: Therefore, if The Olive Garden allows pets, then Tom can move in with Fluffy.  
Step 4: The premise "The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more" tells us the security deposit at The Olive Garden can be $2000 or more.  
Step 5: The premise "Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500" means Tom will only rent if both conditions are met.  
Step 6: Since the security deposit at The Olive Garden is $2000, which is more than $1500, Tom will not rent an apartment there, regardless of whether pets are allowed.  

Step 7:  Therefore, Tom is not allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy.

Step 2:  We also know from the premise "All business organizations are legal entities" that if something is a business organization, then it is a legal entity.
Step 3:  The premises "All companies are business organizations" and "All private companies are companies" tell us that if something is a private company, then it is also a company, and if something is a company, then it is a business organization.
Step 4:  The premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company" doesn't directly tell us if it is a private company or not, only that if it is created under law, it can't be a private company.
Step 5: Since we don't know if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, we cannot definitively say if it is a private company or not.

Step 2: The premise also states that "All legal entities are created under law."
Step 3: This means that if something is a legal entity, it is guaranteed to have legal obligations.
Step 4: We need to determine if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity. 
Step 5:  The premises tell us "All business organizations are legal entities" and "All companies are business organizations."
Step 6:  This means that if something is a company, it is also a business organization, and therefore a legal entity.
Step 7:  The premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company" tells us that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity, it cannot be a private company.
Step 8:  However, the premises do not say that the Harvard Weekly Book Club is *not* created under law. So, it is possible that it is a legal entity.
Step 9:  If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity, then it has legal obligations (from Step 3).
Step 10: If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity, then it cannot be a private company (from Step 7).
Step 11:  Therefore, the statement "The Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations and is a private company" is false.

Step 1: The premise states that "All legal entities have legal obligations."
Step 2: The premise also states that "All legal entities are created under law."
Step 3:  Since all legal entities have legal obligations, and all legal entities are created under law, we can conclude that if something is a legal entity, it must be either created under law or have legal obligations.
Step 4:  The conclusion states "If the Harvard Weekly Book club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law."  
Step 5: Since all companies are business organizations, and all business organizations are legal entities, we can deduce that if something is a private company, it must also be a legal entity.

Step 1: The premise states that "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating."  
Step 2: The premise also states that "All vertebrate animals have a backbone."  
Step 3: Combining these, we can conclude that all vertebrates reproduce by male-and-female mating.  
Step 4: The premise "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" contradicts this conclusion.  
Step 5:  Therefore, bees cannot be vertebrates.  
Step 6: The premise "All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates" means that if something is not a vertebrate, it must be an invertebrate.  
Step 7:  So, bees are invertebrates.  
Step 8: The premise "All queen bees are bees" states that if something is a queen bee, it must also be a bee.  
Step 9:  We know bees are invertebrates, but this doesn't automatically make them queen bees.  
Step 10: The premise "Harry is a bee" only tells us Harry is a bee, not that he is a queen bee.  

Step 11: Therefore, while we know Harry is a bee, we cannot definitively say he is a queen bee.

71 out of 99 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates," we know that any animal must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 2: We also know from the premises "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating" and "All vertebrate animals have a backbone" that all vertebrates reproduce by male-and-female mating.
Step 3:  The premise "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" tells us that all bees, including the queen bee, do not reproduce by this method.
Step 4: Since Harry is a bee, and all bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating, we can conclude that Harry is not a vertebrate.
Step 5:  Therefore, Harry must be an invertebrate.
Step 6:  Since Harry is a bee, and all bees are invertebrates, Harry is also an invertebrate.
Step 7:  The conclusion states that Harry is either an invertebrate or a queen bee.  Since we have established that Harry is an invertebrate, the conclusion is true. </nl_cot>

</answer>
72 out of 100 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates," we know that any animal must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 2: The premise "All vertebrate animals have a backbone" tells us that if an animal is a vertebrate, it will also have a backbone.
Step 3: The premise "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating" tells us that if an animal has a backbone, it must reproduce in this way.
Step 4: The premise "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" tells us that all bees, including the queen bee, reproduce through a different method.
Step 5: Since Harry is a bee, and all bees reproduce differently, Harry cannot be an animal with a backbone.
Step 6: Therefore, if Harry is an animal with a backbone, it would contradict the premises.
Step 7: The only remaining possibility is that Harry is an invertebrate.
Step 8:  Since Harry is an invertebrate and not a queen bee (because all bees are not invertebrates), the statement "If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee" is true.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with their siblings." 
Step 2: We also know "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth." 
Step 3: Combining these, we can infer that if someone has siblings born together, they spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with them.
Step 4: The premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together" doesn't directly contradict the conclusion, so we can't use it to disprove the statement.
Step 5: The premises "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers" and "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" don't directly relate to the conclusion either.
Step 6: The final premise states that Luke is either a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. 
Step 7:  Since we know from steps 1-3 that if someone is born in a multiple birth, they spend a lot of time with their siblings, and the final premise doesn't contradict this, we can conclude that if Luke is born in a multiple birth, he spends a lot of time with his siblings.
Step 8: However, the final premise also states that Luke could be the case where he is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. In this case, we have no information about his siblings or his time spent with them.
Step 9:  Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. The conclusion is uncertain.

73 out of 102 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings" that if someone is born in a multiple birth with siblings, they spend a lot of time with them.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" that if someone spends a lot of time with their siblings, they often live at home.
Step 3:  The premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers" tells us that if someone lives at home, they cannot live with strangers.
Step 4:  The premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they have siblings" is redundant, as having siblings who were born together implies having siblings.
Step 5:  The premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together" tells us that if someone complains often about annoying siblings, they must have siblings who were born together.
Step 6:  The premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" is the key to solving the problem.
Step 7:  We can consider both possible scenarios for Luke:
    - If Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, then he cannot spend a lot of time with his siblings (from Step 3). This means he cannot often live at home (from Step 2), contradicting the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers".
    - If Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers, then he cannot have siblings who were born together (from Step 1 and 2). This means he cannot complain often about annoying siblings (from Step 5).
Step 8:  Therefore, Luke cannot complain often about annoying siblings. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
</answer>
74 out of 103 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers." This means Luke must fall into one of two categories:
    - Category 1: Luke is born in a multiple birth AND lives with strangers.
    - Category 2: Luke is not born in a multiple birth AND does not live with strangers.

Step 2:  We also know from the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home."  This means if someone spends a lot of time with their siblings, they must live at home.

Step 3:  Combining this with the premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings," we can deduce that if someone is born in a multiple birth, they must live at home.

Step 4:  This contradicts the first category (Luke being born in a multiple birth AND living with strangers). Therefore, Luke cannot be in category 1.

Step 5: This means Luke must be in category 2 (not born in a multiple birth AND not living with strangers).

Step 6:  We know from the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they have siblings who were born together." This is always true.

Step 7:  Since Luke is not born in a multiple birth, he cannot have siblings born together.

Step 8:  Therefore, Luke cannot complain often about annoying siblings because the premise states "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together."

Step 9:  The conclusion states that Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.  We have shown that both of these statements are true.

Step 3: Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources available, so he can prove economic hardship.
Step 4: Therefore, ETS would provide financial aid to Tom.
Step 5:  The conclusion states "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something." This is too broad a statement.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy."
Step 2: We also know "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are not notably tidy.
Step 4: The premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy" tells us that being cleanly is a sufficient condition for being notably tidy.
Step 5:  The premise "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" tells us that valuing order and spotlessness is a sufficient condition for being cleanly.
Step 6:  The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if a person's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then the person themselves values it.
Step 7:  We are given that Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
Step 8:  Since Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie and notably tidy (from steps 1 and 3), and Peter cannot be both not cleanly and notably tidy (from steps 4 and 7), Peter must be either a clumsy foodie or cleanly.
Step 9:  If Peter is a clumsy foodie, he is not notably tidy (from step 3).
Step 10: If Peter is cleanly, he is notably tidy (from step 4).

Step 7:  The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if a person's family values order and spotlessness, then that person also values it.
Step 8:  Therefore, if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then he values order and spotlessness, and consequently, he is notably tidy.
Step 9:  The final premise states that "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly."
Step 10:  This means Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie (who spills a lot) and cleanly (and thus notably tidy) at the same time. 
Step 11:  Therefore, if Peter is not a clumsy foodie, he must be the type who does not spill a lot and is not cleanly.
Step 12:  Since he cannot be clumsy and cleanly, and he cannot be neither clumsy nor cleanly, the only remaining option is that he is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness (from Step 8).

79 out of 109 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy."
Step 2: We also know that "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing."
Step 3: This means that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, they cannot be notably tidy.
Step 4:  We are given that "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy." 
Step 5:  We also know that "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly."
Step 6: This means that if someone values order and spotlessness, they must be cleanly.
Step 7: Finally, we are given that "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness."
Step 8: Combining steps 5 and 7, we can conclude that if someone's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, they must be cleanly.
Step 9:  We are given that "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly."
Step 10:  We have already established that if someone spills a lot of food on their clothing, they cannot be notably tidy. Therefore, if Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, he cannot be cleanly.
Step 11: This means that if Peter is cleanly, he cannot spill a lot of food on his clothing. 
Step 12:  We can now combine steps 4, 8, and 11 to conclude that if Peter is cleanly, his family must prioritize order and spotlessness.
Step 13: If Peter is not cleanly, then he must spill a lot of food on his clothing (from step 9).
Step 14:  As established in step 3, if someone spills a lot of food on their clothing, they cannot be a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try. 
Step 15: Therefore, if Peter is not cleanly, he cannot be a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try.
Step 16:  We have now covered all possible scenarios for Peter's state. He is either cleanly and has a family that prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he is not cleanly and is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try. 
Step 17: This statement is the same as the conclusion, so the final answer is (A).

Step 1: The premise states that "All fir trees are evergreens." This means that being a fir tree is a sufficient condition for being an evergreen. 
Step 2: The premise also states that "Some objects of worship are fir trees." This means there are at least some fir trees that are objects of worship.
Step 3:  Since all fir trees are evergreens, and some fir trees are objects of worship, we know there must be at least one evergreen that is also an object of worship.
Step 4: However, the premises do not say that *all* evergreens are objects of worship.  
Step 5: It is possible for an evergreen to not be an object of worship. For example, there are many types of evergreens that are not religious symbols.
Step 6: Therefore, the statement "Some evergreens are not objects of worship" is true.

Step 1: The premise states that "The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas."
Step 2: The premise also states that "Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains."
Step 3:  We need to consider both possibilities:
    - If the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico, then Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico.
    - If the Picuris Mountains are in Texas, then the premise "There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines that have been donated" tells us that the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas.
Step 4: Since the second possibility is ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico.
Step 5: Therefore, Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico. </nl_cot>

Step 1: The premise states that "The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas."
Step 2: The premise also states that "Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains."
Step 3:  We know from the premises that "There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated."  However, this premise does not directly tell us anything about whether or not Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in Texas.
Step 4: Since the Picuris Mountains are located in either New Mexico or Texas, and Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains, we cannot definitively say whether he visited a mountain range in Texas. 
Step 5: The conclusion states "Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in Texas." While this could be true, it's also possible he visited the part of the Picuris Mountains located in New Mexico.
Step 6:  Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether the statement is true or false based on the given information.

Step 1: The premise states that "The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated."
Step 2: The premise also states that "There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated."
Step 3: Since the Harding Pegmatite Mine was donated, and we know there are no donated mines in Texas mountain ranges, the mine cannot be located in Texas.
Step 4: Therefore, the Harding Pegmatite Mine must be located in New Mexico, as it is the only remaining option.
Step 5: The premise "The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas" confirms that the Picuris Mountains are located in New Mexico.
Step 6: Since the Harding Pegmatite Mine is in the Picuris Mountains, and the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico, the Harding Pegmatite Mine must be in New Mexico.
Step 7: The conclusion states that the Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico. This contradicts the reasoning in steps 5 and 6.

Step 1: We know from the premise "If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting." that if someone is taller than another person, they can block their shot.
Step 2: We also know "Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class." This means Michael is the tallest person in his class.
Step 3: The premise "If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z" is a general statement about height relationships.
Step 4:  We are given "Peter is a man who is taller than Michael." This means Peter is taller than the tallest person in Michael's class.
Step 5:  Therefore, Peter is taller than everyone in Michael's class, including Michael.
Step 6: We know "Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting."  
Step 7:  The premise "Michael cannot block Windy's shooting" tells us that Windy is able to jump and shoot.
Step 8:  Since Windy can jump and shoot, and Michael cannot block them, Peter, being taller than Michael, also cannot block Windy's shot.

Step 3:  The premises further state that Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are all located in the South Shetland Islands.
Step 4: Finally, we know that Antarctica is located in the South Shetland Islands.
Step 5:  While we can establish that Barutin Cove is located within Antarctica due to the transitive property (Snow Island is in South Shetland Islands, South Shetland Islands are in Antarctica), the premises do not provide any information about Barutin Cove being named after *all* islands in Antarctica. 
Step 6:  The conclusion states that Barutin Cove is named after *all* islands in Antarctica. This is a much stronger claim than what the premises support.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers" and "If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters." This means that Tesla Model 3s cannot be one-seaters.
Step 2: We also know that "All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters." This means that if something is a single-seat electric car, it must be a one-seater.
Step 3:  The premise states "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car."  This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it must not be either of those things.
Step 4: Since we know Tesla Model 3s can't be one-seaters, the only way John's car can be "not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" is if it's not a single-seat electric car.
Step 5: This means John's car must be a Tesla Model 3.
Step 6:  Since we know Tesla Model 3s transport multiple passengers, and we've established that John's car is a Tesla Model 3, we can conclude that John's car can transport multiple passengers.
Step 7:  However, the premises don't provide any information about whether John's car is a Solo EV. The conclusion states that John's car is a Solo EV, but we have no information to support this claim.

Step 1: We know from the premise "If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters." that if a car can transport multiple passengers, it cannot be a one-seater.
Step 2: The premise "All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers" tells us that all Tesla Model 3 cars can carry more than one passenger.
Step 3:  Since Tesla Model 3s can transport multiple passengers, they cannot be one-seaters.
Step 4: The premise "All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters" states that any car that is a single-seat electric car is also a one-seater.
Step 5:  The premise "All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars" tells us that all Solo EV cars are a type of single-seat electric car.
Step 6:  Combining steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that Tesla Model 3s cannot be single-seat electric cars.
Step 7: The premise "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car"  tells us that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be either a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds" that Rock must be either a monkey or a bird.
Step 2: We are also given "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe." This means Rock can be a flying bird, a non-flying bird, or something that cannot breathe (which wouldn't be a pet).
Step 3:  Since Rock can fly, it must be either a flying bird or a monkey (from Step 1 and Step 2).
Step 4:  The premise "Peter's birds can fly" tells us that if something is Peter's bird, it can fly.  
Step 5:  Therefore, if Rock is a flying bird, it must be Peter's bird.  
Step 6:  But, the premise "All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals" doesn't tell us anything about whether flying birds are mammals. 
Step 7:  We can't definitively say that Rock is a monkey just because it can fly. There's a possibility it's a flying bird that's not a mammal.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings." This means that if a pet of Peter's can fly, we can definitively say it has wings.
Step 2: We are given that "Rock is Peter's pet."
Step 3: We are also given that "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe." This means there are three possible scenarios for Rock:
    - Rock can fly
    - Rock is a bird
    - Rock cannot breathe
Step 4:  We can apply the first premise to the first scenario (Rock can fly). Since Rock is Peter's pet and can fly, we can conclude that Rock has wings.
Step 5: The second scenario (Rock is a bird) is already covered by the premise "All birds can fly."  
Step 6: The third scenario (Rock cannot breathe) doesn't directly contradict the statement "Rock has wings."  

Therefore, the conclusion "Rock has wings" is true.

Step 2:  From the premise "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged," we can deduce that if someone is making wedding plans, they must be engaged.
Step 3:  The premise "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony" tells us that if someone has a well-attended wedding, they must invite others to their ceremony.
Step 4:  The premise "Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families" doesn't directly contradict the other premises. It simply states that there are instances where people with well-attended weddings also have larger families. 
Step 5:  The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, one of two things must be true: either he has a well-attended wedding or he invites friends to their ceremony.
Step 6:  Since we know from Step 1 that if John is engaged, he cannot invite friends and make wedding plans, we can deduce that if John has a larger family, he cannot be engaged.
Step 7:  Therefore, John cannot be engaged and have a larger family simultaneously.
Step 8:  The conclusion states that John does not have a larger family. While we have established that John cannot be engaged and have a larger family, the conclusion doesn't necessarily mean he *doesn't* have a larger family. It simply means that if he has a larger family, he cannot be engaged.

Step 5:  Therefore, if someone has a well-attended wedding, they must be engaged (as per steps 1-3).
Step 6: The premise "Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families" doesn't directly tell us anything about John's engagement status. 
Step 7: Finally, the premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, one of two things must be true: he has a well-attended wedding, or he invites friends to their ceremony. 
Step 8: However, we don't know if John has a larger family.  

Since we lack sufficient information to determine if John has a larger family, and the premises don't directly state whether John is engaged or not, the statement "John is engaged" remains uncertain.

91 out of 130 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans." This means if John is engaged, he cannot be inviting friends and making wedding plans. 
Step 2: We also know "All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans."  This means if someone invites others to their ceremony, they are making wedding plans.
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if John is engaged, he cannot be inviting others to his ceremony.
Step 4: The premise "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony" tells us that if someone has a well-attended wedding, they must invite others to it.
Step 5:  Therefore, if John has a well-attended wedding, he must be inviting others to his ceremony.
Step 6:  But we established in Step 3 that if John is engaged, he cannot invite others to his ceremony. 
Step 7:  This means John cannot be both engaged and have a well-attended wedding.
Step 8:  The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, one of two things must be true: either he has a well-attended wedding or he invites friends to his ceremony.
Step 9:  Since we know from Step 7 that John cannot have a well-attended wedding if he is engaged, the only way for John to have a larger family is if he invites friends to his ceremony.
Step 10:  But we also know from Step 3 that if John is engaged, he cannot invite friends to his ceremony.
Step 11:  Therefore, John cannot be both engaged and have a larger family.
Step 12:  The conclusion states that John neither has a larger family nor invites others to his wedding. This is true because we have established that he cannot be both. </nl_cot>

Step 1: The premise states that "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data." 
Step 2: The premise also states that "Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data."
Step 3:  Therefore, the machine learning algorithm used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model cannot be unsupervised learning.
Step 4: The premise "Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning" tells us the only three possible categories.
Step 5: Since it's not unsupervised, and it's not reinforcement learning (as stated in the premises), the only remaining option is supervised learning. 
Step 6:  Therefore, supervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model. 
</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
96 out of 138 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms" and "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data."
Step 2: We also know that "Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning."
Step 3:  Since the model requires labeled data, and unsupervised learning does not require labeled data, the model cannot be trained with unsupervised learning.
Step 4:  The premise states "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model," so it cannot be trained with reinforcement learning either.
Step 5: Therefore, the only remaining option is supervised learning. 
Step 6:  The conclusion states "Unsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model," which is the opposite of what we have derived.

Step 1: The premise states that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages. 
Step 2: The premise also states that all family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
Step 3:  We know from the premise "If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents." that if a film is appropriate for all ages, it must be rated General Audience.
Step 4: Since "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for all ages, and both of those categories lead to a General Audience rating, we can conclude that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is rated General Audience.

The final answer is (A).
</answer>
97 out of 140 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents," we know that if a film is appropriate for all ages, it cannot contain excessive erotic and violent content. 
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents." This means that if a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, it cannot be appropriate for all ages.
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that a film cannot be both appropriate for all ages and contain excessive erotic and violent content.
Step 4: The premise states that "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages.
Step 5: We know from the premise "All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience" that if a film is family-friendly, it must be rated General Audience.
Step 6: The premise "If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages" tells us that if a film is rated General Audience, it must be appropriate for all ages.
Step 7:  Therefore, if "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is a family-friendly animated film, it must be rated General Audience and appropriate for all ages.
Step 8:  We can combine this with the conclusion from steps 1-3 to say that "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" cannot contain excessive erotic and violent content.
Step 9:  Since "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is not a family-friendly animated film (as stated in the premise), and it cannot contain excessive erotic and violent content, it cannot be in the "Frozen" series either.
Step 10:  Therefore, the statement "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the "Frozen" series or both is false.

The final answer is (B).
</answer>
98 out of 141 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films," we know that if a movie is in the Frozen series, it must be family-friendly and animated.
Step 2: From the premise "All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience," we know that if a movie is family-friendly and animated, it must be rated General Audience.
Step 3: From the premise "If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages," we know that if a movie is rated General Audience, it must be appropriate for people of all ages.
Step 4:  From the premise "If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents," we know that if a movie is appropriate for people of all ages, children can watch it without parental guidance.
Step 5:  We are given that "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages. This means it falls into one of two categories:
    - Category 1: "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is a family-friendly animated film.
    - Category 2: "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages.
Step 6:  If "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is in Category 1 (family-friendly animated), then by steps 2 and 3, it must be rated General Audience and appropriate for all ages.  Therefore, children can watch it without parental guidance.
Step 7: If "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is in Category 2 (appropriate for all ages), then by step 4, children can watch it without parental guidance.
Step 8:  The premise "If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents" states that if a film has excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance.  
Step 9: Since we've established in steps 6 and 7 that "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" is either family-friendly (and thus appropriate for all ages) or appropriate for all ages, and we know that children can watch films appropriate for all ages without guidance, we can conclude that "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" does not contain excessive erotic and violent content.
Step 10: Therefore, "Hachi: A dog’s Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.

Step 1: The premise states that "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs."
Step 2: This implies that aurochs existed at some point in the past, as they served as a model for the Heck cattle breeding program.
Step 3:  The premise "Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals" is a general statement, not specific to aurochs. 
Step 4:  While the breeding program suggests aurochs once existed, it doesn't explicitly state that they are extinct. 
Step 5:  We need additional information to definitively say whether aurochs are extinct or not.

Step 2: We also know "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States."  This means that US citizenship is a prerequisite for voter registration.
Step 3: The premise "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship" tells us that someone must hold one of these two types of citizenship.
Step 4:  "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship" means that if someone is a Russian Federation official, they cannot be Taiwanese.
Step 5:  We are given that "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom." This means Vladimir does not have Taiwanese citizenship.
Step 6: Since Vladimir doesn't have Taiwanese citizenship, and he can't be a Russian Federation official (from step 4), the only remaining possibility is that he has US citizenship.
Step 7:  Since Vladimir has US citizenship (from step 6), he can register to vote in the United States (from step 2).

Step 2: The premise also states that "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds."
Step 3: Therefore, all hydrocarbons contain carbon.
Step 4:  The premise "The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither" means the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element.
Step 5: Since the mixture is not a chemical compound containing only one element, it cannot be a pure element.
Step 6:  This means the mixture must be a combination of different elements.
Step 7:  Since hydrocarbons are organic compounds and contain carbon, and the mixture is not a pure element, it is possible that the mixture contains carbon. 
Step 8: However, we cannot definitively say that the mixture *must* contain carbon.

<answer>
The final answer is (C).
</answer>
109 out of 153 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds" and "All alkanes are hydrocarbons." This means if something is an alkane, it is also an organic compound.
Step 2: We also know "All organic compounds contain carbon." So, if something is an organic compound, it contains carbon.
Step 3:  The premise "The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither" tells us about the mixture's properties. 
Step 4:  Since we know alkanes are organic compounds and organic compounds contain carbon, if the mixture is an alkane, it must also contain carbon.
Step 5: However, the premise "No chemical compounds contain only one element" contradicts the possibility that the mixture is both a chemical compound and contains only one element.
Step 6: Therefore, the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain only one element.
Step 7: This means the mixture must be neither a chemical compound nor contain only one element.

110 out of 154 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither." This means there are only two possibilities for the mixture: 
    - It is a chemical compound and contains only one element. 
    - It is neither a chemical compound nor contains only one element.

Step 2: The premise also states that "No chemical compounds contain only one element." This contradicts the first possibility from Step 1, so the first possibility is false.

Step 3:  Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor contains only one element.

Step 4:  We can rephrase the conclusion as "If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then it cannot be both a chemical compound and an alkane."

Step 2: We also know that "All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library."  
Step 3: This means that if a student has a part-time job offered by the university, they cannot be from the computer science department.
Step 4: The premise "All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department" tells us that if a student is taking the database course, they must be from the computer science department.
Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that a student cannot have both a part-time job offered by the university and be taking the database course.
Step 6:  The premise "All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David" tells us that if a student is working in the lab, they must be taking a class with Professor David.
Step 7:  The premise "All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course" tells us that if a student is taking a class with Professor David, they must be taking the database course.
Step 8:  Combining steps 6 and 7, we can conclude that if a student is working in the lab, they must be taking the database course.
Step 9:  The premise "James is a student working in the lab" tells us that James is working in the lab.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Breaking Bad is a show" that Breaking Bad is a show.
Step 2: We also know from the premises "The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people" and "All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows" that if a show portrays the lives of real people, it must be a reality TV show.
Step 3:  However, the premise "Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show" tells us that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.
Step 4:  Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot be a show that portrays the lives of real people.
Step 5:  The premise "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV" doesn't provide any information about Breaking Bad, so we cannot conclude anything about its airtime based on this premise.
Step 6:  Since we have no information connecting Breaking Bad to 8 pm on Monday, we cannot say for certain whether it airs at that time.

The final answer is (B).
</answer>
118 out of 165 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people" and "All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows." Therefore, The Bachelor is a reality TV show.
Step 2: We also know from the premises that "If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor."  
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can deduce that if a show gives out roses on TV, it must be a reality TV show.
Step 4: However, the premise "Breaking Bad is a show" and "Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show" tell us that Breaking Bad is a show that is not a reality TV show.
Step 5:  Therefore, if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, it cannot be an episode of The Bachelor, and thus, it cannot be on Monday at 8 pm (as the premise "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV" only applies to shows that are episodes of The Bachelor).
Step 6:  The final statement "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm" is false.

Step 2: This directly implies that Heinrich Schmidt was German.
Step 3: The premise does not provide any information about his nationality other than being German.
Step 4: Therefore, we cannot definitively say he was also Russian or both.
Step 5: The conclusion states "Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian or both."
Step 6: Since we know he was German, the conclusion is true in the sense that it includes a true statement (he was German). 
Step 7: However, we lack information to confirm if he was also Russian.

Step 1: The premise states that "Severe cancers are deadly diseases."
Step 2: The premise also states that "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate."
Step 3:  Therefore, we can conclude that severe cancers come with a low survival rate.
Step 4: The conclusion states that "Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer."
Step 5:  Since we know severe cancers come with a low survival rate, and colorectal cancer is a severe cancer, we can deduce that colorectal cancer also comes with a low survival rate.
Step 6: However, the premise "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate" tells us that colorectal cancer cannot be both.
Step 7: Since colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer, it cannot be a severe cancer (because all bile duct cancers are severe).

Step 1: The premise states "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu."
Step 2: We know from the premises that "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer."  Therefore, if colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, it is also a kind of bile duct cancer.
Step 3: However, the premise "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate" tells us that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, it cannot also have a low survival rate.
Step 4: The premise "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate" states that if something is deadly, it has a low survival rate.
Step 5:  We know from the premises that "Severe cancers are deadly diseases."  Therefore, if something is a severe cancer, it has a low survival rate.
Step 6:  Since colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and a low survival rate, it cannot be a severe cancer.
Step 7:  Therefore, if colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, it cannot be a severe cancer.
Step 8:  Since colorectal cancer cannot be a severe cancer, it cannot be a kind of mild flu.
Step 9:  Therefore, the conclusion "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu" is false.

The final answer is (B).
</answer>
121 out of 171 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "Severe cancers are deadly diseases" and "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate." This means that all severe cancers have a low survival rate.
Step 2: We also know that "Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer," so bile duct cancer has a low survival rate.
Step 3: The premise states "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer," meaning if something is Cholangiocarcinoma, it is also bile duct cancer.
Step 4: Since bile duct cancer has a low survival rate, we can conclude that all Cholangiocarcinoma also has a low survival rate.
Step 5: The premise "Mild flu comes with a low survival rate" tells us that mild flu has a low survival rate.
Step 6:  The premise "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate" means that colorectal cancer cannot be both a bile duct cancer and have a low survival rate.
Step 7: Since colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer, and we know all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer, we can conclude that colorectal cancer cannot be Cholangiocarcinoma.
Step 8:  We cannot definitively say that colorectal cancer is a kind of mild flu because we only know that mild flu has a low survival rate, and we don't know if colorectal cancer does or not. 

Therefore, the final answer is that colorectal cancer is neither a form of Cholangiocarcinoma nor a kind of mild flu.

Step 1: From the premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither," we know that Taylor cannot be both. 
Step 2: If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then by the premise "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly," we can conclude that Taylor eats salads regularly.
Step 3: If Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she cannot be very conscious about her health and eating habits (from the premise "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits").
Step 4: Since Taylor cannot be very conscious about her health and eating habits, and she also cannot disregard her physical well-being (from the premise "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits"), we can conclude that Taylor must not eat salads regularly.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes."
Step 2: We also know that "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits."
Step 3:  From the premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither," we can deduce that if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she cannot disregard her physical well-being, and vice versa.
Step 4:  Since Taylor cannot be both health-conscious and disregarding her well-being, if she is health-conscious, she must fulfill her daily nutritional intakes.
Step 5:  Therefore, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she must visit the gym at least once a day (from the premise "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes").
Step 6:  If Taylor did neither (grew up in a health-conscious home nor disregarded her physical well-being), then she cannot be health-conscious and must disregard her physical well-being.
Step 7:  But this contradicts the premise "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits," so this scenario is not possible.
Step 8:  Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and visits the gym at least once a day.


</nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
122 out of 174 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither" that Taylor's situation falls into one of two mutually exclusive scenarios:
    - Scenario 1: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
    - Scenario 2: Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home.

Step 2:  Let's analyze each scenario:
    - **Scenario 1:** If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then according to the premise "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly", Taylor would eat salads regularly. This means she would be "very conscious about her health and eating habits" (premise "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits").  
    - **Scenario 2:** If Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she cannot be "very conscious about her health and eating habits" (from the premise "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits"). 

Step 3:  We also know that "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits".  
    - If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home (Scenario 1), she cannot disregard her physical well-being because that would contradict the premise "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly".  
    - If Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home (Scenario 2), she cannot be "very conscious about her health and eating habits" as established in Step 2.  

Step 4: The conclusion states that Taylor "neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day".  
    - We have already established that Taylor's situation must fall into either Scenario 1 or Scenario 2.  
    -  Since Scenario 1 is not possible (it leads to a contradiction), Taylor must be in Scenario 2.  
    -  The premise "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes" and "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes" do not directly contradict Scenario 2. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day.  

Step 5:  The conclusion states that Taylor "neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day". We have established that Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home (Scenario 2), but we cannot definitively say she does not visit the gym at least once a day.

Step 1: The premise states that "All pet owners love animals." Since Tom is a pet owner, we know Tom loves animals.
Step 2: The premise also states that "All animal lovers are nice to animals."  Since Tom loves animals, we can conclude that Tom is nice to animals.
Step 3:  The premise "No one nice to animals is also mean to animals" tells us that if someone is nice to animals, they cannot also be mean to animals.
Step 4:  Therefore, since Tom is nice to animals, we can deduce that Tom cannot be mean to animals.
Step 5:  The premise "Some grumpy people are mean to animals" doesn't directly contradict Tom's niceness to animals. It only states that *some* grumpy people are mean to animals, not that *all* grumpy people are mean to animals. 
Step 6:  We have no information to suggest that Tom is grumpy. 

Therefore, the statement "Tom is a grumpy person" remains uncertain.

Step 1: From the premise "All pet owners love animals," we know that Tom, being a pet owner, must love animals.
Step 2: From the premise "All animal lovers are nice to animals," we can deduce that Tom, as an animal lover, is also nice to animals.
Step 3: The premise "No one nice to animals is also mean to animals" states that if someone is nice to animals, they cannot simultaneously be mean to animals.
Step 4: Since Tom is nice to animals (from Step 2), we can apply Step 3 to conclude that Tom cannot be mean to animals.
Step 5:  Therefore, Tom cannot be both a grumpy person (from the premise "Some grumpy people are mean to animals") and mean to animals (from Step 4).

Step 3:  The premises focus on basketball skills and physical actions (jumping, activating leg muscles) and do not provide any information about Yuri's nationality.
Step 4: Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about Yuri's nationality based on the given information. 
Step 5: The statement "Yuri is an American national" remains unproven.

134 out of 188 is correct!
Step 1: The premises state that "Yuri does not activate his leg muscles."
Step 2: We also know from the premises that "If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles."
Step 3:  Therefore, Yuri cannot leap straight into the air.
Step 4:  The premise "If someone can do jump shots, they leap straight into the air" tells us that if someone can do jump shots, they must be able to leap straight into the air.
Step 5: Since Yuri cannot leap straight into the air, he cannot do jump shots.
Step 6: The premise "All professional basketball players can do jump shots" means that if someone is a professional basketball player, they can do jump shots.
Step 7:  Since Yuri cannot do jump shots, he cannot be a professional basketball player.
Step 8: The conclusion states "Yuri is not an American professional basketball player." While we have established that Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player, the premises do not say anything about his nationality.  

Step 9: Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Yuri is or is not an American professional basketball player.

134 out of 189 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states "Yuri does not activate his leg muscles." 
Step 2: We also know "If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that Yuri cannot leap straight into the air.
Step 4:  The premise "All professional basketball players can do jump shots" implies that if someone is a professional basketball player, they can leap straight into the air.
Step 5:  Since Yuri cannot leap straight into the air, he cannot be a professional basketball player.
Step 6: The premise "Some professional basketball players are not American nationals" is irrelevant to this conclusion as it doesn't directly relate to Yuri's nationality.

Step 7: Therefore, the conclusion "Yuri is an American professional basketball player" is false.

135 out of 190 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles." 
Step 2: We are also given that "Yuri does not activate his leg muscles."
Step 3: Therefore, Yuri cannot leap straight into the air.
Step 4:  The conclusion states "If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player."
Step 5: Since we have established in Step 3 that Yuri does not leap straight into the air, the conclusion follows.
Step 6: However, the premises do not provide any information about Yuri's nationality or whether he is a basketball player. 
Step 7:  Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Yuri is an American professional basketball player just because he doesn't leap straight into the air. 
Step 8: The conclusion is true based on the given information, but it's important to note that it doesn't directly imply anything about Yuri's nationality or profession. </nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
</answer>
135 out of 191 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "Some professional basketball players are not American nationals." This means there are professional basketball players who are not American.
Step 2: The conclusion states "If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player."  This is a conditional statement.
Step 3: Since we know from Step 1 that there are professional basketball players who are not American, it's possible for Yuri to be one of those players.
Step 4: If Yuri is a professional basketball player who is not American, then the conclusion "If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player" is true. 
Step 5: However, the conclusion doesn't state that Yuri is not American. It only states that if Yuri is not American, then he must be a professional basketball player. This is a different statement and doesn't necessarily mean Yuri is a professional basketball player. 
Step 6:  The premise "Yuri does not activate his leg muscles" is irrelevant to the conclusion. It doesn't tell us anything about Yuri's nationality or whether he is a professional basketball player. 

Therefore, the conclusion is not definitively true or false based on the given information.

Step 1: The premise states that "Events are either happy or sad." This means there are only these two categories for events.
Step 2: The premise also states "At least one event is happy." This means there is at least one event that falls into the "happy" category.
Step 3:  Since all events must fall into either the "happy" or "sad" category, and we know there's at least one "happy" event, it's impossible for *all* events to be sad. 
Step 4: Therefore, the statement "All events are sad" is false. </nl_cot>

Step 1: The premise states that "The winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer."
Step 2:  We also know "Steinhauer participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic."
Step 3:  The premise "One six-way tie was on the leaderboard, and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium" doesn't directly contradict the fact that Steinhauer won.
Step 4: The premise "Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic" tells us about Descampe, but it doesn't directly contradict Steinhauer being the winner.
Step 5:  Since the premises don't provide any information suggesting Steinhauer didn't win, and we know from step 1 that Steinhauer was the winner, the conclusion "Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic" is false. 
</nl_cot>

The final answer is (B).
</answer>
137 out of 194 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "One six-way tie was on the leaderboard, and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium." that there was a six-way tie and at least one person from Belgium was involved.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic" that Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard.
Step 3: Since Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard, and we know there was a six-way tie involving at least one Belgian, it is possible that Descampe is part of that tie.
Step 4: However, the premises do not provide enough information to definitively say that Descampe is *in* the six-way tie. It's possible Descampe tied with five other players, or that Descampe tied with someone else and that person was the Belgian. 

Therefore, while it's possible, we cannot definitively say whether Descampe is in the six-way tie.

Step 1: From the premise "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs," we know that if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then KiKi must be terricolous or have legs. 
Step 2: We can combine this with the premise "If an animal has legs, then it jumps" to deduce that if KiKi has legs, then it must also jump.
Step 3:  Since Jane likes all animals that jump and KiKi would have to jump if it has legs, we can conclude that if KiKi has legs, Jane would like KiKi.
Step 4: However, the premise "Jane does not like any animals that bark" tells us that Jane dislikes any animal that barks.  
Step 5: Since all dogs are animals that bark, and we know KiKi is an animal, we can deduce that if KiKi is a dog, Jane would dislike KiKi.
Step 6: Therefore, KiKi cannot be a dog. 
Step 7:  Since KiKi cannot be a dog (which would make it bark and therefore disliked by Jane), and KiKi cannot be neither a jumper nor have legs (as that would lead to it being terricolous or having legs, contradicting the premise "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs"), KiKi must have legs and jump.
Step 8:  This means KiKi is not terricolous, as the premise states "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs."

138 out of 196 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "Jane does not like any animals that bark" and "All dogs are animals that bark".  This means if something is a dog, Jane does not like it.
Step 2: We also know "Jane likes all animals that jump".  
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if something is a dog (and therefore barks), Jane cannot like it.  
Step 4: The premises state "If an animal has legs, then it jumps" and "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs". This means if an animal is terricolous, it must have legs and therefore jump.
Step 5: We are given "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs".  This seems contradictory, as if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, it cannot be terricolous (by the previous step).
Step 6:  Therefore, KiKi must either jump or have legs.  
Step 7:  Since KiKi is an animal, and we know "Jane likes all animals that jump", if KiKi jumps, Jane likes it.
Step 8:  If KiKi has legs, it must also jump (from Step 4), and Jane would like it.
Step 9:  We are left with the conclusion that KiKi must be either a jumping animal (which Jane likes) or a leg-having animal (which also jumps and is liked by Jane).
Step 10: Since all dogs are barking animals, and we've established KiKi is not a barking animal (from Step 1), KiKi cannot be a dog.

139 out of 197 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "Jane does not like any animals that bark" and "All dogs are animals that bark". This means if an animal barks, Jane dislikes it.
Step 2: We also know "Jane likes all animals that jump".
Step 3: Combining these, we can infer that Jane dislikes all dogs.
Step 4:  The premise "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs" seems contradictory. If KiKi doesn't jump or have legs, it cannot be both terricolous and have legs. This implies that KiKi either jumps or has legs.
Step 5:  Since KiKi either jumps or has legs, and Jane likes all animals that jump, KiKi must be an animal that Jane likes.
Step 6: However, we know Jane dislikes all dogs, and we haven't established that KiKi is not a dog. 
Step 7:  Therefore, we cannot definitively say that KiKi does not bark and is not a dog. The conclusion is uncertain. </nl_cot>
