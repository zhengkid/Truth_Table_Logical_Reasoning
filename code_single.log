[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a rigorous and logically precise AI assistant. Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /beacon-scratch/tongzh24/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

[2025-03-21 02:44:34,673] [WARNING] [stage3.py:2114:step] 1 pytorch allocator cache flushes since last step. this happens when there is high memory pressure and is detrimental to performance. if this is happening frequently consider adjusting settings to reduce memory consumption. If you are unable to make the cache flushes go away consider adding get_accelerator().empty_cache() calls in your training loop to ensure that all ranks flush their caches at the same time

Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /beacon-scratch/tongzh24/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /beacon-scratch/tongzh24/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.
