This means the premises are inconsistent and we cannot derive a logical conclusion.\n\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| C (Cat is blue) | R (Cat is red) | V (Cat visits cow) | B (Cow is blue) | N (Cow needs cat) | M (Cow needs mouse) | T (Cow visits mouse) | G (Mouse is red) | E (Mouse needs cow) | Ti (Tiger is blue) | TiV (Tiger visits cat) |\n|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| True            | True           | True                | True            | True            | True             | True             | True            | True             | True            | True             |\n| True            | True           | True                | True            | True            | True             | True             | True            | True             | True            | True             |\n<end_of_truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>"
