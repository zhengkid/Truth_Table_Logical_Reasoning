This information is irrelevant to whether Tom receives financial aid.\n2. **Premise 2:** ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. This establishes the condition for receiving aid.\n3. **Premise 3:** Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship. This provides a way to qualify for financial aid.\n4. **Premise 4:** Tom lives in a single-parent family. This means Tom might be eligible for aid based on Premise 3.\n5. **Premise 5:** Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. This further strengthens Tom's eligibility for aid based on Premise 3.\n6. **Premise 6:** Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
