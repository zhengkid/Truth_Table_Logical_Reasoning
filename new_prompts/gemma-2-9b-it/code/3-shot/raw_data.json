Premise 6 states Bonnie is either a student or not. Therefore, Bonnie cannot be a student and thus cannot be a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities (Premise 5).\n\n* **If Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances:** Premise 2 tells us she must either perform in school talent shows often or be inactive and disinterested. If she performs in school talent shows often, Premise 1 tells us she attends and is very engaged with school events. This contradicts Premise 6 if she is also inactive and disinterested.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion cannot be true in either scenario.\n\n\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n</answer>",

Therefore, if Rockie is a rabbit, it is cute.\n\n3. **Rockie's Calmness:** Premise 6 states Rockie is calm. \n\n4. **Squirrels are Skittish:** Premise 5 states all squirrels spotted near the campus are skittish. Since Rockie is not a squirrel, it cannot be skittish.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Combining points 2 and 4, we know Rockie is either cute (because it's a rabbit) or not skittish (because it's not a squirrel).\n\n\n</nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n</answer>",
