(C \u2228 \u00acC \u2192 (Y \u2227 I))\n\nLogical Chain:\n\n1. **Analyze the conclusion:**  The conclusion is a conditional statement. It states that if Bonnie chaperones high school dances (C) or does not (\u00acC), then she must be both a young child/teenager who wishes to further her education (Y) and an inactive/disinterested community member (I).\n\n2. **Break down the premises:**  Examine each premise carefully to identify relationships between the variables (C, T, S, Y, I).  Look for ways to connect these relationships to the conclusion.\n\n3. **Identify potential contradictions:** Look for any premises that might directly contradict the conclusion or parts of it.\n\n4. **Construct a truth table:** Create a truth table to systematically evaluate all possible combinations of truth values for the variables.  \n\n5. **Test the conclusion:**  For each row in the truth table, evaluate the truth value of the conclusion (C \u2228 \u00acC \u2192 (Y \u2227 I)). If the conclusion is true for all possible combinations, then the statement is true. If there is at least one row where the conclusion is false, then the statement is false. \n\n\n\n</truth_table> \n</answer>",

If John's car is a Tesla Model 3 (T is true), it can transport multiple passengers (M is true), which means it cannot be a one-seater (\u00acO is true). However, premise 3 states that single-seat electric cars are one-seaters (S \u2192 O).\n\n4.

If your response contains a `<code>` block, **you MUST always ensure it is properly enclosed with `</code>` at the end**. Never omit this closing tag.\n\n3. After your reasoning process, output your final answer enclosed within an `<answer>` tag.\n\n4.
