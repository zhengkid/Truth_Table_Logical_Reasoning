                "content": "You will be provided with a logical reasoning problem. Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPeople in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPeople in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\nPeople in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\nAll people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nAll young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. \nBonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nBonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPeople in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPeople in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\nPeople in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\nAll people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nAll young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. \nBonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5.

Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nA Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.\nAll games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.\nIf a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.\nThe Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. \nSome turtles can be spotted near the campus. \nThe only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.\nIf something is skittish, then it is not calm.\nAll the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.\nRockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nRockie is not a turtle.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold.

Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. \nSome turtles can be spotted near the campus. \nThe only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.\nIf something is skittish, then it is not calm.\nAll the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.\nRockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold.

Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\n\"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.\nIf a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.\nIf and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.\nKaren does not download \"Black Mirror.\"\n\"Black Mirror\" is a Netflix show.\nIf Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nKaren will share \"Black Mirror\" with Lisa.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

                "content": "You will be provided with a logical reasoning problem. Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBeijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China. \nBeijing is the capital city of the world's most populous nation.\nBeijing is located in Northern China.\nBeijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games.\nBeijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics.\nMany of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best universities in the world.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nBeijing is located in southern China.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nEveryone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\nEvery Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.\nAll Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.\nAll professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.\nIf a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.\nIf a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous.\nAll well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.\nDjokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nDjokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nDiamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.\nRoderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.\nDiamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile.\nImperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nImperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSymphony No. 9 is a music piece.\nComposers write music pieces.\nBeethoven wrote Symphony No. 9.\nVienna Music Society premiered Symphony No. 9.\nVienna Music Society is an orchestra.\nBeethoven leads the Vienna Music Society.\nOrchestras are led by conductors.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nBeethoven is not a conductor.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8.

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.

Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5.

                "content": "You will be provided with a logical reasoning problem. Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. \nEveryone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.\nAll female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\nAll tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.\nAll male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.\nIf Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\nCoco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nCoco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll cats are mammals.\nSome pets are not mammals.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nNo pets are cats.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7.

Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package.

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.

Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5.

Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll Romance languages are Indo-European languages.\nRomance languages are a language family.\nAll languages within a language family are related to each other.\nFrench and Spanish are both Romance languages.\nGerman is related to Spanish.\nBasque is not related to any other language.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nFrench is an Indo-European language.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBillings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.\nThe state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.\nWhite Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.\nThe city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.\nAny city in Butte is not in St Pierre.\nA city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nSt Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll Brown Swiss cattle are cows.\nSome pets are Brown Swiss Cattle.\nAll cows are domesticated animals.\nAlligators are not domesticated animals.\nTed is an alligator.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTed is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold.

Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nYale University is a private Ivy League research university.\nYale University moved to New Haven in 1716.\nYale university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.\nA list of residential colleges at Yale: Benjamin Franklin College, Berkeley College, Branford College, Davenport College, Ezra Stiles College, Grace Hopper College, Jonathan Edwards College, Morse College, Pauli Murray College, Pierson College, Saybrook College, Silliman College, Timothy Dwight College, and Trumbull College.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nYale University has the largest university endowment of any educational institution.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

                "content": "You will be provided with a logical reasoning problem. Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBadults is a British Sitcom series starring members of Pappy's.\nBadults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three.\nThe Working title \"The Secret Dude Society\" was used for Badults.\nAndrew Collins was the script editor for Badults.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nAndrew Collins was the script editor for a series with the working title \"The Secret Dude Society\".\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34.\nPlates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul. \nJoe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. \nTom's license plate begins with the number 35. \nIf a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJoe's license plate begins with the number 34.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5.

Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7.

Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8.

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\nSome restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\nAll restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.\nThe Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBooks contain tons of knowledge.\nWhen a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. \nIf a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.\nHarry read the book \u201cWalden\u201d by Henry Thoreau.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nHarry is smarter than before.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

                "content": "You will be provided with a logical reasoning problem. Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nA natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.\nIf the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.\nMachine translation is a natural language processing task.\nThe output of machine translation is a text sequence.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nMachine translation is a language understanding task.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPets are allowed in some managed buildings.\nA deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.\nThe security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.\nFluffy is Tom's cat.\nCats are pets.\nThe Olive Garden is a managed building.\nThe monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.\n$2000 is more than $1500.\nTom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\nIf a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package.

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7.

Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.\nAll clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.\nIf people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.\nIf people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.\nAll people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.\nPeter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nPeter is either a  clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or he is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nThe Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas.\nJuan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.\nThe Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.\nThere are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThe Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7.

Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nBarutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.\nBarutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.\nSnow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.\nAntarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. \nIf place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nThere is at least one cove in Antarctica named after a place in Bulgaria.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nAll Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.\nAll single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\nAll Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. \nIf John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJohn's car is a Tesla Model 3.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

                "content": "You will be provided with a logical reasoning problem. Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nAll Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.\nAll single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\nAll Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. \nIf John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJohn's car is not a Solo EV.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold.

Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.\nAll people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.\nAnyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.\nSome people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.\nIf John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.\nIf John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJohn does not have a larger family.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nPlungers suck.\nVacuums suck.\nVampires suck.\nSpace is a vacuum.\nA duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf something is a household appliance, it sucks.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

                "content": "You will be provided with a logical reasoning problem. Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.\nIf a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.\nIf a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.\nAll family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.\nAll movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is a film.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is rated General Audience.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.\nIf a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.\nIf a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.\nAll family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.\nAll movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d is a film.\n\u201cHachi: A dog\u2019s Tale\u201d  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\n\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the \"Frozen\" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the \"Frozen\" series.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8.

Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll hydrocarbons are organic compounds .\nAll alkanes are hydrocarbons\nAll organic compounds are chemical compounds.\nAll organic compounds contain carbon.\nNo chemical compounds contain only one element.\nThe mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. \n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNone of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. \nAll of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. \nAll of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. \nAll of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. \nAll students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.\nJames is a student working in the lab. \nJames doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nJames does not have a part-time job offered by the university.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nA hawk never swims. \nSome birds are hawks.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nAll birds swim.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.\nIf a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.\nThe Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.\nAll shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.\nBreaking Bad is a show.\nBreaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nIf something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. \nSevere cancers are deadly diseases.\nBile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. \nAll Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\nMild flu comes with a low survival rate.\nColorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold.

Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nAll people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\nAll people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\nAll people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nIf people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\nTaylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nTaylor visits the gym at least once a day.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.

Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAll horses have hooves.\nNo humans have hooves.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nSome humans are horses.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package.

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.

Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nNo one nice to animals is also mean to animals.\nSome grumpy people are mean to animals.\nAll animal lovers are nice to animals.\nAll pet owners love animals.\nTom is a pet owner.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold.

If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome professional basketball players are not American nationals.\nAll professional basketball players can do jump shots.\nIf someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.\nIf someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. \nYuri does not activate his leg muscles.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nYuri is not an American professional basketball player.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nSome professional basketball players are not American nationals.\nAll professional basketball players can do jump shots.\nIf someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.\nIf someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. \nYuri does not activate his leg muscles.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nIf Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5.

Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7.

Your task is to translate this problem text into Python code using Z3 SMT solver. \n\n\nInstructions for the translation:\n\n  1.\tImport Z3\n      - At the beginning of your code, import the necessary functions and classes from the Z3 Python package. For example:\n        from z3 import *\n      - This provides access to all basic Z3 classes and functions like Solver, Function, ForAll, BoolSort(), DeclareSort(), etc.\n  2.\tDefine the Domain (Sorts)\n      - Determine the type(s) of objects relevant in the logical problem. If the problem discusses abstract individuals (like people), you can create a custom Z3 sort via:\n        Person = DeclareSort('Person')\n      - If the problem uses integers, reals, or bitvectors, you may use built-in sorts:\n        x = Int('x')\n        y = Real('y')\n      - Choose whichever domain is appropriate for the entities in your problem.\n  3.  Declare Constants and Variables\n      - For any specific named individuals (e.g., \"Peter\"), declare a Z3 constant of the corresponding sort:\n        p = Const('p', Person)  # for \"Peter\"\n      - For universally or existentially quantified elements, you can declare a variable:\n        x = Const('x', Person)\n      - If you have multiple named entities, define separate constants (e.g., m for \"Michael\").\n  4. Define Predicates or Functions\n      - For each statement like \"x grows vegetables,\" \"x has ample space,\" or \"x is a young working professional,\" create a Boolean-valued function:\n        GrowsVeg = Function('GrowsVeg', Person, BoolSort())\n        AmpleSpace = Function('AmpleSpace', Person, BoolSort())\n        YoungWorkingPro = Function('YoungWorkingPro', Person, BoolSort())\n      - If you need numeric properties or more complex functions, use the appropriate Sort for the function's return type.\n  5. Initialize the Solver\n      - Create a Z3 Solver instance. This is where you will add your premises:\n        s = Solver()\n  6. Encode and Add the Premises\n      - For each natural-language premise of the form \"For all x, if [Condition] then [Consequence],\" you can write:\n        s.add(ForAll([x], Implies( Condition_on_x, Consequence_for_x )))\n      - If you have direct facts like \"Peter is a neighbor of Michael,\" add them as simple constraints:\n        s.add(Neighbor(p, m))\n      - Combine logical connectives (And, Or, Not, etc.) as needed.\n  7. Check the Conclusion and Its Negation\n      - To decide whether a conclusion C is necessarily true, false, or uncertain, test both:\n        - Check negation C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(Not(conclusion))\n          result_neg = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_neg == unsat, then the premises contradict negation C, Thus, negation C is impossible whenever the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily true.\n        - Check C:\n          solver.push()\n          solver.add(conclusion)\n          result_pos = solver.check()\n          solver.pop()\n          - If result_pos == unsat, then the premises contradict C. Thus, C is impossible if the premises hold. Therefore, C must be necessarily false (the negation is guaranteed).\n        - Combine the Results:\n          - If result_neg == unsat, we conclude C is necessarily true. \n          - Otherwise, if result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat, C is necessarily false.\n          - Otherwise, if both checks return sat, that means there exist models (interpretations) where C is true and models where C is false - therefore, the conclusion is uncertain (not entailed nor refuted by the premises).\n          - If both results are unknown or you get another combination, you may need more sophisticated tactics, or the solver cannot decide under the current theory.\n  8. Derive the Final Outcome\n      - Use the following logic to interpret the solver results:\n        from z3 import unsat, sat, unknown\n        if result_neg == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with Not(conclusion) => Conclusion necessarily true\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily TRUE.\")\n            result = 'True'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == unsat:\n            # Contradiction with conclusion => Conclusion necessarily false\n            print(\"Conclusion is necessarily FALSE.\")\n            result = 'False'\n        elif result_neg == sat and result_pos == sat:\n            # Both are satisfiable => It's uncertain\n            print(\"Conclusion is UNCERTAIN (not guaranteed by the premises).\")\n            result = 'Uncertain'\n        else:\n            # Possible 'unknown' or unexpected scenario\n            print(\"Unexpected or unknown result.\")\n            result = 'Unknown'\n\n\nhe premises will start and end with <Premises> and </Premises>, the conclusion will start and end with <Conclusion> and </Conclusion> and the Python translation will start and end with <PYTHON> and </PYTHON>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<Premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</Premises>\n<Conclusion>\nAilton Silva played for Fluminense.\n</Conclusion>\n<PYTHON>\n"
