This means if James is a manager, then he will appear in the company, and if he does not appear in the company, then he is not a manager.\n    From (6), no managers work remotely from home.\n    From (4), if an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.\n    From (3), employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.\n    From (2), everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.\n    From (1), all employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.\n    From (5), all employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.\n    Now, let's analyze the possibilities:\n    * If James is a manager (M = True), then he will appear in the company (from 7). This means he does not have lunch at home (from 4) and does not work remotely (from 6). \n    * If James is not a manager (M = False), then he will not appear in the company (from 7). This means he either has lunch at home (from 3) or at the company (from 3). If he has lunch at home, then he works remotely (from 4).\n    * If James is in another country (C = True), then he works remotely (from 5). This contradicts the case where he has lunch at home and is not a manager.\n    * Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that James does not have lunch in the company (E = False).\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| M (Manager) | E (Lunch in company) | R (Remotely) | C (In other country) |\n|-------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| True         | False             | False        | False             |\n| False        | True              | True         | False             |\n<end_of_truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>",

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
