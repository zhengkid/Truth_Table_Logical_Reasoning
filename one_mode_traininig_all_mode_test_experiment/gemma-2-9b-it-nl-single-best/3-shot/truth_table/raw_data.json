This means she cannot be a young child or teenager in this club who wishes to further their academic careers and educational opportunities, according to the premise \"All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\"  \n\nStep 4:  Since she's not a student who attends the school, she can't be a student who chaperones high school dances according to the premise \"People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\"  \n\nStep 5:  Because she's not a student who chaperones high school dances, she can't be an inactive and disinterested member of her community, according to the premise \"All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\"  \n\nStep 6:  Since she's not an inactive and disinterested member of her community, she must perform in school talent shows often according to the premise \"People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\"  \n\nStep 7: Therefore, regardless of which category Bonnie falls into, she must perform in school talent shows often.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>",

It states that if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances OR performs in talent shows often, then she MUST be both a young child/teenager pursuing academics AND an inactive/disinterested community member.  \n\nStep 2: We know from premise 3 that chaperones are NOT students.  \n\nStep 3: We also know from premise 4 that inactive/disinterested members are ALL chaperones.  \n\nStep 4: Combining these, we can say that if Bonnie chaperones, she CANNOT be a student pursuing academics (premise 5).  \n\nStep 5:  The premise 1 states that those who perform in talent shows are engaged with school events, implying they ARE students.  \n\nStep 6:  Premise 2 says club members are either performers OR inactive/disinterested.  \n\nStep 7: Therefore, if Bonnie performs in talent shows, she is a student and cannot be inactive/disinterested.  \n\nStep 8:  The conclusion claims Bonnie MUST be BOTH a student pursuing academics AND inactive/disinterested, which is a contradiction.  \n\nStep 9:  Because the conclusion forces a contradiction, it cannot be true.  \n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>",

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

It must be one or the other.\n\nStep 9:  The conclusion states \"\u201cHachi: A dog's Tale\u201d either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the \"Frozen\" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the \"Frozen\" series.\" This is logically equivalent to our conclusion in Step 8.\n\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>",

Therefore, G \u2227 D must be false.\n    Therefore, \u00acG \u2227 \u00acD must be true.\n    If \u00acG \u2227 \u00acD is true, then from (5), if Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day, she does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes.\n    Therefore, \u00acV is true.\n    Thus, \u00acG \u2227 \u00acV is true.\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| G (Grew up in health-conscious childhood home) | D (Disregards physical well-being) | F (Fulfills daily nutritional intakes) | V (Visits gym at least once a day) | \u00acG \u2227 \u00acV (Neither grew up in health-conscious home nor visits gym) |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| True                                        | True                              | True                                 | True                                    | False                                           |\n| True                                        | True                              | True                                 | False                                   | False                                           |\n| True                                        | False                             | False                                | True                                    | False                                           |\n| True                                        | False                             | False                                | False                                   | False                                           |\n| False                                       | True                              | False                                | True                                    | True                                            |\n| False                                       | True                              | False                                | False                                   | True                                            |\n| False                                       | False                             | True                                 | True                                    | False                                           |\n| False                                       | False                             | True                                 | False                                   | True                                            |\n<end_of_truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>",

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input.
