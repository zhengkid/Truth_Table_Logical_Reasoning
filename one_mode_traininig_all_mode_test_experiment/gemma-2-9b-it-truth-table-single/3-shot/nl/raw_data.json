Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

It does not directly state whether 1984 is a streaming service or a hardcover book, but it implies that if it is one, it must also be the other.\nStep 4:  To analyze this further, let:\n    - S: 1984 is a streaming service\n    - H: 1984 is a hardcover book\n    - D: 1984 is digital media\n    - A: 1984 is analog media\nPremises:\n    - \u00acD \u2227 A (No digital media are analog)\n    - H \u2192 A (Every printed text is analog media)\n    - S \u2192 D (All streaming services are digital media)\n    - H \u2192 S (If 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is a streaming service)\nConclusion to Evaluate:\n    - \u00acS (1984 is not a streaming service)\nLogical Chain:\n    - We cannot definitively conclude that 1984 is not a streaming service. The premise S \u2192 H states that if 1984 is a streaming service, then it's a hardcover book. However, it doesn't say anything about whether 1984 is actually a streaming service.

(E \u2228 M)\nConclusion to Evaluate:\n    Vladimir is a Russian Federation official (R)\n\nLogical Chain:\n\n1.  From (4): \u00acT \u2227 \u00acM is true.  \n2.  From (4), we know \u00acT is true.  \n3.  From (3), we know either C is true or T is true. Since T is false (from step 2), C must be true.  \n4.  From (2), we know C is true.  \n5.  From (1), we know \u00acT is true.  \n6.  From (3), we know either C is true or T is true. Since T is false (from step 2), C must be true.  \n7.  From (2) and (6), we know both C and \u00acT are true.  \n8.  From (7), we can conclude that R is false.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>",
