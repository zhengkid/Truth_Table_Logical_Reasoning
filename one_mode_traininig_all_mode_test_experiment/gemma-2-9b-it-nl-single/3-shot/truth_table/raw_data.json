The premise states \"People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\" Since Bonnie falls into this category, we can conclude that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\n    - **Category 2:** Bonnie does NOT attend and is very engaged with school events AND is NOT a student who attends the school. This category doesn't directly lead us to the conclusion that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\nStep 4:  Since Category 1 leads to the conclusion, and Bonnie must fall into one of the two categories, we can definitively say that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>",

We also know from the premise \"KO is a mature stock\" that KO belongs to the category of mature stocks.\n3. The premise \"All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund\" tells us that if a stock is mature, it is suitable for a retirement fund.\n4. The premise \"If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund\"  means that stocks bought for rapid price appreciation are *not* suitable for retirement funds.\n5. The premise \"All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation\" means that if a stock is a growth stock, it is bought for rapid price appreciation.\n6. Combining steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that if a stock is bought for rapid price appreciation, it cannot be a mature stock.\n7. Since we know KO is a mature stock, it cannot be a growth stock (from step 6).\n8. We know KO is a mature stock, and all mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds (step 3).\n9.

It seems to suggest that if Hannah needs to earn money, then she can't be both picky and need to earn money. This doesn't directly contradict our previous deductions, but it doesn't provide additional information to definitively say she's not picky.\nStep 9: Since we know Hannah either orders takeout frequently or enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, and both of those scenarios lead to her not being a picky eater and spending a lot of time in the dining halls, we can conclude that Hannah is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\nStep 10: Therefore, the statement \"Hannah is at Mary's school and she is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\" is true.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>",

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This can be represented as E \u2228 Fr.\nLogical Chain:\n    From (7), we know that \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is either F or G.\n    From (2) and (3), we know that if a film is G, then it is also rated General Audience.\n    From (4), we know that if a film is F, then it is also rated General Audience.\n    Therefore, \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is either F and rated General Audience or G and rated General Audience.\n    However, this doesn't directly tell us if it contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the \"Frozen\" series.\n    We need more information to determine if E is true or Fr is true.\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| F (Family-friendly animated film) | G (Appropriate for people of all ages) | E (Contains excessive erotic and violent content) | Fr (In the \"Frozen\" series) | E \u2228 Fr |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| True                               | True                                  | True                                                | False                         | True    |\n| True                               | True                                  | False                                               | False                         | False   |\n| True                               | False                                 | True                                                | False                         | True    |\n| True                               | False                                 | False                                               | False                         | False   |\n| False                              | True                                  | True                                                | False                         | True    |\n| False                              | True                                  | False                                               | False                         | False   |\n| False                              | False                                 | True                                                | False                         | True    |\n| False                              | False                                 | False                                               | False                         | False   |\n<end_of_truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>",

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
