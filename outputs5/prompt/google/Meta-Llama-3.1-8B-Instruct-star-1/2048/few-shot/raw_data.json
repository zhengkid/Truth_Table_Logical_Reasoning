It updates the cost of the GRE test to $205 and marks it as cheaper than $300. It also checks if the person has economic hardship based on the premises.\n*   The `run_inference` function runs the `apply_premises` function repeatedly until no more updates are made.\n*   The `check_conclusion` function checks the conclusion based on the updated `GRE` and `Person` objects. If the cost of the GRE test is unknown or if the person's economic hardship status is unknown, it returns \"Uncertain\". If the cost of the GRE test is below $300, it returns \"True\". Otherwise, it returns \"False\".\n*   The `func` function creates a `GRE` object and a `Person` object and calls the `check_conclusion` function to get the final answer.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the final answer, which is \"True\".</Answer>",

There is no information in the premises about the day or time of Breaking Bad, so we cannot determine whether it is on Monday at 8 pm or not.
