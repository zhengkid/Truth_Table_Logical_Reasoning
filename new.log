Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /beacon-scratch/tongzh24/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school" that if someone in the club chaperones high school dances, they do not attend the school.
Step 3: The premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances" tells us that if someone in the club is inactive and disinterested, they chaperone high school dances.
Step 4: The premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" tells us that if someone in the club is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career, they attend the school.
Step 5: The premise "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school" tells us Bonnie is in the club and has one of two possibilities: she is both very engaged and attends school, or she is not both very engaged and attends school.
Step 6: Combining steps 1 and 5, if Bonnie is both very engaged and attends school, then she performs in talent shows often.
Step 7: Combining steps 2 and 5, if Bonnie is not both very engaged and attends school, then she does not chaperone high school dances.
Step 8: Combining steps 3 and 7, if Bonnie is not both very engaged and attends school, then she is not inactive and disinterested.
Step 9: Combining steps 4 and 7, if Bonnie is not both very engaged and attends school, then she is not a young child or teenager wishing to further their academic career.
Step 10: Therefore, the only way Bonnie can be in the club and not perform in talent shows often is if she is a young child or teenager wishing to further their academic career.
Step 11: Since Bonnie is in the club, she cannot be a young child or teenager wishing to further their academic career.
Step 12: Therefore, Bonnie must perform in talent shows often.

Step 1: We know from the premise "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school" that if someone in the club chaperones dances, they cannot also be a student. 
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances" that if someone in the club is inactive and disinterested, they chaperone dances.
Step 3:  Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if someone in the club is inactive and disinterested, they cannot be a student.
Step 4: The premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" tells us that if someone in the club is a young child or teenager wishing to further their academic career, they are a student.
Step 5:  Therefore, if someone in the club is a young child or teenager wishing to further their academic career, they cannot be inactive and disinterested.
Step 6: Combining steps 3 and 5, we can conclude that if someone in the club is a young child or teenager wishing to further their academic career, they must be a student.
Step 7: The conclusion states that if Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
Step 8:  This conclusion essentially says that if Bonnie is a young child or teenager wishing to further her academic career and chaperones dances, she is a student. 
Step 9: This is consistent with steps 4 and 6.
Step 10:  Therefore, the conclusion is true.

    - She attends school, is very engaged with school events, and is a student.
    - She does not attend school, is not very engaged with school events, and is not a student.
Step 2:  We also know "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events."
Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, she must be a student who attends school and is very engaged with school events.
Step 4: We also know "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school."
Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, she cannot be someone who chaperones high school dances.
Step 6:  We also know "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances."
Step 7: Combining steps 5 and 6, if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, she cannot be an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
Step 8:  We also know "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school."
Step 9: Combining steps 3 and 8, if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, she must be a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities.
Step 10: We have established that Bonnie is a student, attends school, is very engaged with school events, and is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities. 
Step 11: The conclusion states that Bonnie is "both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community." 
Step 12: We know from steps 9 and 7 that Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, but we also know she is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community. 
Step 13: Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: From the premise "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" and "Rockie can be spotted near the campus and it is calm," we can conclude that Rockie is a cute animal.
Step 2: From the premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" and "Rockie is a cute animal," we can deduce that Rockie cannot be a squirrel.
Step 3: Since Rockie is cute and not a squirrel, it must be a rabbit.
Step 4: The premise "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" states that if something is skittish, it cannot be calm.
Step 5: Since Rockie is calm, it cannot be skittish.
Step 6: Therefore, the statement "If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle" is false.

Step 2: The premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style" tells us that there are only these two possibilities for a style that Max adores.
Step 3: We know from the premise "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative and dreamy" that if a style is Kelly Wearstler's and adored by Max, it is both evocative and dreamy.
Step 4: Therefore, if a style adored by Max is Kelly Wearstler's, it is both evocative and dreamy. 
Step 5: Since all styles adored by Max are either Zaha Hadid's or Kelly Wearstler's, we can conclude that some styles adored by Max are both evocative and dreamy. 
Step 6:  However, we don't know if any of the Zaha Hadid styles adored by Max are also evocative and dreamy.

Step 2:  From the premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style," we know that every design Max adores must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 3:  We also know "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries."
Step 4: The premise "No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries" tells us that if something is brutalist and adored by Max, it does not have interesting geometries.
Step 5:  The premise "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative" combines steps 3 and 5 to say that if something is Zaha Hadid and adored by Max, it is both brutalist and evocative.
Step 6:  Combining steps 1, 2, 4, and 5, we can see that if something is adored by Max, it cannot be both brutalist and dreamy.
Step 7:  Therefore, if something is adored by Max, it must be either evocative or dreamy, as these are the only two possibilities left.

Step 6:  From the premise "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis," we can conclude that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly, she is one of the most active players in major tennis.
Step 7:  From the premise "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association," we can conclude that if Coco Gauff lost to Iga Świątek, she is ranked highly.
Step 8:  Therefore, if Coco Gauff is female, she is both ranked highly and lost to Iga Świątek.
Step 9:  From the premise "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022," we can conclude that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly, she cannot be a male tennis player.
Step 10:  This contradicts our initial assumption that Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, so Coco Gauff cannot be female.
Step 11:  Therefore, Coco Gauff must be male.
Step 12:  From the premise "All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal," we can conclude that Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal.

28 out of 44 is correct!
Step 1:  From the premises "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male" and "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek", we can conclude that all tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
Step 2:  From the premises "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis" and "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association", we can conclude that everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is one of the most active players in major tennis.
Step 3:  Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that all tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are one of the most active players in major tennis.
Step 4:  The premise "Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022" tells us that Coco Gauff is a tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Step 5:  Therefore, Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.
Step 6:  The conclusion states that Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis. 
Step 7:  Since we know Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis (step 5), the conclusion is false.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season."
Step 2: We also know that "Emma wants to have a long vacation" and "Emma's favorite season is summer."
Step 3: Therefore, Emma's favorite season is summer.
Step 4: The premise states that "Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's."
Step 5: Since Emma's favorite season is summer, Mia's favorite season cannot be summer.
Step 6: The premises do not provide information about which other season Mia's favorite season could be.
Step 7:  It is possible that Mia's favorite season is spring, fall, or winter.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "No digital media are analog" that if something is digital media, it cannot be analog.
Step 3:  Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if something is a streaming service, it cannot be analog.
Step 4: The premise "If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text" tells us that if something is a hardcover book, it must be printed text.
Step 5: The premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book" tells us that if 1984 is a streaming service, it must also be a hardcover book.
Step 6: Combining steps 3 and 5, we can conclude that if 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be printed text.
Step 7: Since 1984 is not necessarily a streaming service, we cannot definitively say that it is printed text.

The final answer is (C).
<end_of_answer>
31 out of 49 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "No digital media are analog" and "All streaming services are digital media." Therefore, we can conclude that "No streaming services are analog."

Step 2: We also know from the premises that "Every printed text is analog media."

Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that "No printed text is a streaming service."

Step 4: The premise states that "If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text."

Step 5: Therefore, if an object is a hardcover book, it is not a streaming service.

Step 6: The premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book" is a conditional statement. It states that if 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 must also be a hardcover book.

Step 7: Since we know from steps 3 and 5 that printed text is not a streaming service, this conditional statement is inherently contradictory.

Step 8: The contradiction means that 1984 cannot be a streaming service.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All streaming services are digital media" that if something is a streaming service, it is also digital media.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "No digital media are analog" that if something is digital media, it cannot be analog.
Step 3: The premise "If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text" tells us that hardcover books are a type of printed text.
Step 4: The premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book" combines steps 1 and 3, meaning that if 1984 is a streaming service, it must be a hardcover book.
Step 5: We now have a chain of reasoning:
    - If 1984 is a streaming service, then it is digital media (Step 1).
    - If 1984 is digital media, then it cannot be analog (Step 2).
    - If 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is printed text (Step 3).
    - If 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is printed text (Step 4).
Step 6: Since printed text is analog (Step 3), we have a contradiction.
Step 7: Therefore, 1984 cannot be a streaming service.

Step 4: From the premise "The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana," we know that St Pierre is not in Montana.
Step 5: Since St Pierre is not in Montana and Montana contains Butte, White Sulphur Springs, Helena, and Missoula, we can conclude that St Pierre is in a different state than any of those cities.
Step 6: We are given no information about the state of Bismarck. Therefore, we cannot determine whether or not Bismarck is in the same state as St Pierre.

Step 4:  The premise "Some stocks are growth stocks" tells us there exist stocks that are growth stocks.  However, it doesn't tell us anything about whether or not KO is one of those stocks.

Step 5:  Since we know KO is a mature stock and mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds, we can conclude that KO is not a growth stock.

Step 6:  Since KO is not a growth stock, we can't conclude anything about whether or not it is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.

Step 7:  The conclusion states that if KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, it is neither a stock nor is its price volatile. This statement is too broad.  While we know KO is not a growth stock, we don't know if it is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say it is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.

Step 1: The premise states "All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34."
Step 2: The premise also states "Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul."
Step 3: We are given that "Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul."
Step 4: Combining steps 1 and 3, we can conclude that Joe's license plate must begin with the number 34. 
Step 5: The premise "Tom's license plate begins with the number 35" and "If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34" are irrelevant to Joe's license plate.
Step 6: Therefore, the final conclusion is that Joe's license plate begins with the number 34.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34" that if something is from Istanbul, its registration plate starts with 34.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul" that if something doesn't start with 34, it cannot be from Istanbul.
Step 3: The premise "Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul" tells us that Joe's plate starts with 34.
Step 4: The premise "Tom's license plate begins with the number 35" tells us Tom's plate does not start with 34.
Step 5:  The premise "If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34" confirms that Tom's plate does not start with 34.
Step 6: Since Tom's plate doesn't start with 34 and Joe's plate does, we can conclude that Tom's plate is not from Istanbul.

Step 3:  The premise states that "Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews."
Step 4:  The premise "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four" tells us that if a restaurant is popular, it has a high rating.
Step 5:  The premise "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents" tells us that the Hamden Plaza Subway store either has a high rating or is popular.

 57%|█████▋    | 4/7 [00:26<00:18,  6.11s/it]Step 1: From the premises "All companies are business organizations" and "All business organizations are legal entities," we can conclude that "All companies are legal entities."

Step 2: From the premise "All legal entities are created under law," we know that if something is a legal entity, it is created under law.

Step 3: From the premise "All legal entities have legal obligations," we know that if something is a legal entity, it has legal obligations.

Step 4: The premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company" tells us that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity, it cannot also be a private company.

Step 5:  Combining steps 1 and 2, we know that if something is a company, it is a legal entity.

Step 6: Combining steps 3 and 5, we know that if something is a company, it has legal obligations.

Step 7:  Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a company, it is both a legal entity and has legal obligations.

Step 8:  However, the premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company" contradicts the conclusion that it is a private company. 

Step 9:  Therefore, the Harvard Weekly Book Club cannot be both a company and a private company.

Step 10: Since it cannot be both, it cannot have the characteristics of both.

68 out of 97 is correct!
Step 1:  From the premise "All companies are business organizations" and "All business organizations are legal entities," we know that all companies are legal entities.

Step 2: From the premise "All legal entities are created under law," we know that if something is a legal entity, it is created under law.

Step 3:  The premise "All legal entities have legal obligations" states that if something is a legal entity, it has legal obligations.

Step 4: Combining steps 1, 2, and 3, we can conclude that if something is a company, it is created under law and has legal obligations.

Step 5: The premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company" presents a potential contradiction. This means if it is created under law, it cannot be a private company.

Step 6: Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, it cannot be created under law.

Step 7: Since it cannot be created under law, it cannot have legal obligations (from steps 1-3).

Step 8: This means the statement "If the Harvard Weekly Book club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law" is false.

Step 1: From the premise "All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates," we know Harry must be either an invertebrate or a vertebrate.
Step 2: From the premise "All vertebrate animals have a backbone" and the fact that Harry is an animal, we know Harry has a backbone if Harry is a vertebrate.
Step 3: From the premise "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating" and the fact that Harry has a backbone (if Harry is a vertebrate), we know Harry reproduces by male-and-female mating.
Step 4: From the premise "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating," we know Harry is not a bee if Harry reproduces by male-and-female mating.
Step 5: From the premise "All queen bees are bees," we know Harry is a queen bee if Harry is a bee.
Step 6: Since Harry is not a bee (Step 4) and Harry is an animal (Step 1), Harry cannot be a queen bee (Step 5).

The final answer is (B).
<end_of_answer>
68 out of 99 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates," we know that any animal must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 2: From the premise "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating," we know that if an animal has a backbone, it reproduces in this way.
Step 3: The premise "All vertebrate animals have a backbone" confirms that if something is a vertebrate, it has a backbone.
Step 4: The premise "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" tells us that bees, as a group, do not reproduce this way.
Step 5: The premise "All queen bees are bees" confirms that if something is a queen bee, it is also a bee.
Step 6: The premise "Harry is a bee" tells us that Harry is a member of the bee group.
Step 7: Combining steps 4 and 6, we know Harry is a bee, and bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
Step 8: Since Harry is a bee and does not reproduce by male-and-female mating, Harry cannot be a vertebrate (steps 2 and 3).
Step 9: Since Harry is an animal (step 6) and not a vertebrate, Harry must be an invertebrate.
Step 10: Combining steps 6 and 9, we know Harry is both a bee and an invertebrate.
Step 11: The conclusion states that Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee. This is true, as we know Harry is both.

Step 1:  We know from the premise "Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates" that Harry must be one or the other.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating" and "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" that Harry cannot be both a vertebrate and a bee.
Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that Harry is an invertebrate.
Step 4:  The premise "All queen bees are bees" tells us that if Harry is a queen bee, then Harry is also a bee.
Step 5: Since Harry is an invertebrate and cannot be a bee (from steps 2 and 3), Harry cannot be a queen bee.
Step 6: Therefore, Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.
Step 7: The conclusion states that Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee, which is what we have established.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" that Luke cannot be both born in a multiple birth and live with strangers. 
Step 2: If Luke is born in a multiple birth, then he has siblings.
Step 3: If Luke has siblings, then he spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with them. 
Step 4: Therefore, if Luke is born in a multiple birth, then he spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. 
Step 5:  If Luke does not live with strangers, then he lives at home.
Step 6: If Luke lives at home, then he spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.
Step 7: Therefore, if Luke does not live with strangers, then he spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.
Step 8: Since Luke cannot be both born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, we can conclude that Luke either is born in a multiple birth and spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings, or he does not live with strangers and spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.
Step 9: In either case, Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.

Step 1: From the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers," we know Luke is in one of two possibilities. 
Step 2:  Let's consider the first possibility, "Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers."
Step 3: From the premise "If people are born in a multiple birth with siblings, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings," we know that if Luke is born in a multiple birth, he spends a lot of time with his siblings.
Step 4: From the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home," we know that if Luke spends a lot of time with his siblings, he often lives at home.
Step 5: From the premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers," we know that if Luke lives at home, he does not live with strangers.
Step 6:  This contradicts our initial assumption that Luke is born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.
Step 7: Let's consider the second possibility, "Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers."
Step 8: From the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth," we know that if Luke has siblings born together, he is born in a multiple birth.
Step 9: Since Luke is not born in a multiple birth, he does not have siblings born together.
Step 10: From the premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together," we know that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, he has siblings born together.
Step 11: Since Luke does not have siblings born together, he does not complain often about annoying siblings.
Step 12: Therefore, Luke does not complain often about annoying siblings.

70 out of 103 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings" that if someone is born in a multiple birth, they spend a lot of time with their siblings.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth" that if someone has siblings born together, they themselves were born in a multiple birth.
Step 3: The premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together" tells us that if someone complains about annoying siblings, they have siblings born together.
Step 4:  The premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers" tells us that if someone lives at home, they do not live with strangers.
Step 5: The premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" tells us that if someone spends a lot of time with their siblings, they often live at home.
Step 6: The conclusion states that "Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings."
Step 7:  We need to analyze Luke's situation based on the premises.
Step 8:  The premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" presents Luke's situation as a dichotomy. 
Step 9:  We can break down this dichotomy into two possibilities:
    - If Luke is born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, then he spends a lot of time with his siblings (Step 1).
    - If Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers, then he does not complain about annoying siblings (Step 3).
Step 10: Since Luke's situation is a dichotomy, one of these possibilities must be true. 
Step 11: Therefore, Luke is either born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or he is not born in a multiple birth and does not complain about annoying siblings.
Step 12:  This means the conclusion "Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings" is a possibility, but not necessarily the only possibility.

Step 2: We also know "ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship."
Step 3: The premises state that "Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship."
Step 4: We are given that "Tom lives in a single-parent family."
Step 5: The premise also states that "Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them."
Step 6:  Therefore, Tom can prove economic hardship.
Step 7: Since Tom can prove economic hardship and ETS provides financial aid to those who do, Tom can receive financial aid from ETS.
Step 8: This contradicts the conclusion that "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something." 
Step 9: The conclusion is therefore false.

Step 6: The premise "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" tells us that if Peter values order and spotlessness, he is cleanly.
Step 7: Combining steps 5 and 6, we see that if Peter's family values order and spotlessness, he is cleanly.
Step 8: Since Peter cannot be both clumsy and notably tidy (Step 4), and if his family values order and spotlessness he is cleanly (Step 7), we can conclude that Peter must be someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.

Step 3:  Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if someone spills a lot of food on their clothing, they cannot be cleanly.

Step 4: The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if someone's family values order and spotlessness, then the person themselves values order and spotlessness.

Step 5:  The premise "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" tells us that if someone values order and spotlessness, they are cleanly.

Step 6: Combining steps 4 and 5, we can conclude that if someone's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.

Step 7: The premise "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing" tells us that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, they spill a lot of food on their clothing.

Step 8: Combining steps 3 and 7, we can conclude that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, they cannot be cleanly.

Step 9: The premise "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly" tells us that Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and cleanly.

Step 10: Combining steps 8 and 9, we can conclude that Peter is neither a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor is he cleanly.

Step 11: Combining steps 6 and 10, we can conclude that Peter's family does not prioritize order and spotlessness.

Step 12: Therefore, Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.

Step 2: The premise "Some objects of worship are fir trees" tells us there exists at least one object of worship that is also a fir tree.
Step 3: Since we know all fir trees are evergreens, this means there is at least one evergreen that is an object of worship.
Step 4: However, the premises don't state that *all* objects of worship are fir trees.  It's possible that some objects of worship are not fir trees.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin."
Step 2: We also know that "Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island."
Step 3: The premises state that "Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands."
Step 4: The premises also say that "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands."
Step 5: Combining steps 2, 3, and 4, we can deduce that Barutin Cove is located in Antarctica.
Step 6: Since Barutin Cove is named after a Bulgarian settlement, we can conclude that there is at least one cove in Antarctica named after a place in Bulgaria.

Step 1: From the premise "All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals," we know that if something is Peter's pet and a mammal, it must also be an animal.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All monkeys are mammals" that if something is a monkey, it is a mammal.
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if something is Peter's pet and a monkey, it is an animal.
Step 4: The premise "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds" tells us that every pet belongs to one of these two categories.
Step 5: The premise "Peter's birds can fly" states that if something is Peter's bird, it can fly.
Step 6: The premise "All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe" states that if something is Peter's pet and an animal, it can breathe.
Step 7: The premise "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings" states that if something is Peter's pet and can fly, it has wings.
Step 8: The premise "Rock is Peter's pet" tells us Rock belongs to one of the categories of Peter's pets.
Step 9: The premise "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe" describes Rock's characteristics.
Step 10: Since Rock is Peter's pet and can fly, we know from steps 1-7 that Rock is an animal and can breathe.
Step 11: However, we don't know if Rock is a bird or a monkey.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals." 
Step 2: We also know that "All monkeys are mammals."
Step 3: Therefore, all of Peter's pets that are monkeys are also animals.
Step 4: The premise states that "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds."
Step 5:  We also know that "Peter's birds can fly."
Step 6: The premise "All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe" tells us that Rock, being Peter's pet, is an animal and therefore can breathe.
Step 7:  The premise "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings" tells us that if Rock can fly, then Rock has wings.
Step 8:  The premise "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe" presents us with three possibilities for Rock.
Step 9: Since Rock is Peter's pet and therefore an animal (Step 6), we can eliminate the possibility that Rock cannot breathe.
Step 10:  We are left with two possibilities: Rock is a bird or Rock can fly.
Step 11:  If Rock is a bird, then Rock can fly (Step 5).
Step 12:  Therefore, Rock either has wings (Step 7) or is a bird (Step 11), and since birds have wings (Step 5), Rock has wings.

Step 1: From the premise "All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals," we know that if something is a mammal and Peter's pet, then it is also an animal.

Step 2: From the premise "All monkeys are mammals," we know that if something is a monkey, then it is a mammal.

Step 3: The premise "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds" tells us that any pet belonging to Peter must be either a monkey or a bird.

Step 4: The premise "Peter's birds can fly" states that all birds belonging to Peter can fly.

Step 5: The premise "All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe" tells us that if something is an animal and Peter's pet, then it can breathe.

Step 6: The premise "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings" states that if something is a pet belonging to Peter and can fly, then it has wings.

Step 7: The premise "Rock is Peter's pet" tells us that Rock is subject to all the above rules.

Step 8: The premise "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe" presents Rock's possible states.

Step 9:  We need to analyze Rock's state. 
    - If Rock can fly, then it is a bird (Step 4) and therefore has wings (Step 6). 
    - If Rock is a bird, then it can fly (Step 4) and therefore has wings (Step 6). 
    - If Rock cannot breathe, then it cannot be a mammal (Step 5). 
    - If Rock is not a mammal, then it cannot be a monkey (Step 2). 
    - Since Rock is a pet (Step 7), it must be either a monkey or a bird. 
    - Therefore, Rock must be a bird and can fly, meaning it has wings.

Step 10:  Since Rock is a bird and can fly, it has wings (Step 6).

Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony are engaged."
Step 4:  The premise states that "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony."
Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that "All people who have well-attended weddings are engaged."
Step 6: The premise "Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families" tells us there exists at least one person with a well-attended wedding and a larger family. 
Step 7: However, this doesn't tell us anything specific about John's family size.
Step 8: The premise "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans" tells us that if John is engaged, then John does not fit the pattern established in steps 3 and 4.
Step 9: Therefore, if John is engaged, then John does not have a well-attended wedding.
Step 10: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, then John either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
Step 11: Since we know from step 8 that if John is engaged, then John does not have a well-attended wedding, we can conclude that if John is engaged, then John does not have a larger family.
Step 12: Therefore, John cannot have a larger family if John is engaged.
Step 13: Since we don't know if John is engaged or not, we cannot definitively say that John does not have a larger family.

Step 2: We also know "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model."

Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can deduce that the state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained using either supervised learning or unsupervised learning.

Step 4: The premise states "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data."

Step 5: The premise "Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data" tells us that if a model uses unsupervised learning, it does not require labeled data.

Step 6: Since the state-of-the-art text summarization model requires labeled data, we can conclude that it is not trained using unsupervised learning.

Step 7: Therefore, the statement "Unsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" is false.

Step 1: From the premise "All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films," we know that if something is in the Frozen series, it is family-friendly animated.
Step 2: We also know that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a film and is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages.
Step 3: The premise states that "If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents."
Step 4: The premise also states that "If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents."
Step 5: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
Step 6:  Combining steps 4 and 5, we can deduce that if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content, then children cannot watch it without guidance from parents.
Step 7: Since we don't have information about whether or not "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content, we cannot definitively say it is either appropriate for all ages or contains excessive erotic and violent content.
Step 8: Therefore, we cannot definitively say that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is rated General Audience.

Step 7: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that if a film is in the Frozen series, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
Step 8: Therefore, if a film is either in the Frozen series or is rated General Audience, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
Step 9: This means that if a film is not in the Frozen series and is not rated General Audience, then children cannot watch it without guidance from parents.
Step 10:  We are given that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for people of all ages. 
Step 11: Since family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience (step 2), "Hachi: A dog's Tale" must be rated General Audience.
Step 12: Since "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is rated General Audience, children can watch it without guidance from parents (step 6).
Step 13: Therefore, "Hachi: A dog's Tale" does not contain excessive erotic and violent content (step 5).
Step 14: Since "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is not in the Frozen series (given information), it cannot be in the Frozen series.
Step 15:  Therefore, "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the Frozen series or both is false.

Step 2: The premise also states "If George has access to a program, he can compose."
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if George likes music and has access to a program, he wants to compose and can compose.
Step 4: The premise "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose" tells us that if George has the ability and the desire to compose, he will actually do it.
Step 5: Therefore, if George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose.
Step 6:  The conclusion states "If George will not compose, George can not compose." 
Step 7: This is a contrapositive statement of the premise "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose."
Step 8:  The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.
Step 9:  Since the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. 
Step 10:  Therefore, if George will not compose, George can not compose.

Step 4:  Therefore, if Breaking Bad were a reality TV show, it would portray the lives of real people.
Step 5: Since Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, it does not portray the lives of real people.
Step 6: The premise "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV" does not provide any information about what show that is or if it is related to Breaking Bad.
Step 7: The premise "If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor" does not provide any information about when or what day the show airs.
Step 8:  Since we lack information connecting Breaking Bad to the shows airing at 8 pm on Monday or giving out roses, we cannot conclude that Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm.

114 out of 165 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Breaking Bad is a show" that Breaking Bad has the potential to give out roses.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor" that if a show gives out roses, it must be The Bachelor.
Step 3: The premise "The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people" tells us that The Bachelor is a reality TV show.
Step 4: The premise "All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows" confirms that if a show portrays real people, it is a reality TV show.
Step 5: The premise "Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show" tells us that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.
Step 6:  Since Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, it cannot be The Bachelor, and therefore cannot give out roses.
Step 7: Therefore, if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, it contradicts our established knowledge and is impossible.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate."
Step 2: We also know that "Severe cancers are deadly diseases."
Step 3: We are given that "Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer."
Step 4: The premise states that "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer."
Step 5: We are given that "Mild flu comes with a low survival rate."
Step 6: The premise "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate" tells us that colorectal cancer cannot be both.
Step 7: Combining steps 2-4, we can conclude that bile duct cancer is a deadly disease.
Step 8: Since bile duct cancer is a deadly disease, it has a low survival rate (Step 1).
Step 9: Combining steps 4 and 8, we can conclude that Cholangiocarcinoma has a low survival rate.
Step 10: The conclusion states that "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu." This statement combines two possibilities:
    - If colorectal cancer is bile duct cancer, then it is also a deadly disease (Step 7) and has a low survival rate (Step 8).
    - If colorectal cancer is Cholangiocarcinoma, then it is also a deadly disease (Step 9) and has a low survival rate (Step 9).
Step 11:  In both cases, the conclusion is true. 
Step 12: Therefore, the statement "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu" is true.

Step 1:  From the premise "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits," we know that if someone eats salads regularly, they are very conscious about their health and eating habits. 
Step 2:  From the premise "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly," we know that if someone grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, they eat salads regularly.
Step 3:  From the premise "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes," we know that if someone fulfills their daily nutritional intakes, they grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
Step 4:  From the premise "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits," we know that if someone disregards their physical well-being, they are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
Step 5:  From the premise "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes," we know that if someone visits the gym at least once a day, they fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Step 6:  From the premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither," we know that Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being, or she did neither.
Step 7:  We need to analyze the two possibilities in Step 6 and see if either leads to Taylor eating salads regularly.
    - If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being, then she eats salads regularly (from Step 2).
    - If Taylor did neither, then she does not eat salads regularly (from Step 4 and Step 2).
Step 8:  Therefore, the only way Taylor can eat salads regularly is if she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being.
Step 9:  We don't have enough information to determine if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home or disregards her physical well-being.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits" and "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits". These two statements combined mean that people who eat salads regularly do not disregard their physical well-being. 
Step 2: We also know "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly" and "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes". Combining these two statements, we can conclude that all people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes eat salads regularly.
Step 3: We are given that "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes".
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that all people who visit the gym at least once a day eat salads regularly.
Step 5: We are also given that "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither".
Step 6: Since we know from steps 1 and 4 that people who eat salads regularly do not disregard their physical well-being, and we also know from steps 2 and 3 that people who visit the gym regularly eat salads, we can conclude that people who visit the gym regularly did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard their physical well-being.

Step 6:  Combining steps 3 and 5, we can conclude that if someone visits the gym at least once a day, they grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
Step 7:  The premise "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither" presents a dilemma for Taylor. 
Step 8:  If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then by steps 2 and 6, she would eat salads regularly and visit the gym at least once a day. 
Step 9:  Therefore, the only way Taylor can satisfy the premise in step 7 is if she neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day.

Step 5: Combining steps 2 and 4, we can deduce that if someone is a professional basketball player, they activate their leg muscles.
Step 6: Since Yuri does not activate his leg muscles (Step 1) and we know that all professional basketball players activate their leg muscles (Step 5), we can conclude that Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
Step 7:  The premise "Some professional basketball players are not American nationals" tells us that there exist professional basketball players who are not American. However, this does not directly relate to Yuri's nationality.
Step 8: Therefore, while we know Yuri is not a professional basketball player (Steps 1-6), we cannot conclude anything about his nationality.

133 out of 189 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Yuri does not activate his leg muscles," we know Yuri does not possess the ability to leap straight into the air.
Step 2: From the premise "If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles," we know that if someone can leap straight into the air, they must activate their leg muscles.
Step 3: Since Yuri does not activate his leg muscles and the premises state that leaping straight into the air requires activating leg muscles, we can conclude that Yuri cannot leap straight into the air.
Step 4: From the premise "All professional basketball players can do jump shots" and "If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air," we can conclude that all professional basketball players can leap straight into the air.
Step 5: Since Yuri cannot leap straight into the air and all professional basketball players can leap straight into the air, Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
Step 6: The premise "Some professional basketball players are not American nationals" does not directly relate to Yuri's ability to play basketball or leap straight into the air. 
Step 7: Therefore, Yuri is not a professional basketball player, and the statement "Yuri is an American professional basketball player" is false.

Step 1: The premise states that "Events are either happy or sad." This means that every event must fall into one of these two categories. 
Step 2: The premise also states "At least one event is happy." This tells us there exists at least one event that is not sad.
Step 3: Since all events are either happy or sad, and at least one is happy, it is impossible for all events to be sad.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Jane does not like any animals that bark" and "All dogs are animals that bark" that Jane does not like dogs.
Step 2: We also know "Jane likes all animals that jump."
Step 3: The premise "If an animal has legs, then it jumps" tells us that if an animal has legs, it is capable of jumping.
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that Jane likes animals with legs.
Step 5: The premise "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs" tells us that if an animal is terricolous, it has legs.
Step 6: Combining steps 4 and 5, we can conclude that Jane likes terricolous animals.
Step 7: The premise "KiKi is an animal" tells us that KiKi is subject to the rules we've established.
Step 8: The premise "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs" presents a dilemma. This means if KiKi doesn't jump and doesn't have legs, it must be terricolous.
Step 9: Since we know Jane likes terricolous animals, and KiKi is an animal, KiKi must be either terricolous or has legs.
Step 10: We don't have enough information to definitively say whether KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

Step 1: From the premise "Jane does not like any animals that bark," we know that if something is an animal that barks, Jane does not like it.
Step 2: From the premise "All dogs are animals that bark," we know that if something is a dog, it is an animal that barks.
Step 3: From the premise "Jane likes all animals that jump," we know that if something is an animal that jumps, Jane likes it.
Step 4: From the premise "If an animal has legs, then it jumps," we know that if something is an animal with legs, it is an animal that jumps.
Step 5: From the premise "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs," we know that if something is an animal that is terricolous, it has legs.
Step 6: We are given that KiKi is an animal.
Step 7: We also know that "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs." This means that if KiKi doesn't jump and doesn't have legs, it must be terricolous.
Step 8:  Let's consider the possibilities:
    - If KiKi is an animal that barks, then Jane does not like it.
    - If KiKi is a dog, then it is an animal that barks.
    - If KiKi is an animal that jumps, then Jane likes it.
    - If KiKi has legs, then it is an animal that jumps.
    - If KiKi is terricolous, then it has legs.
Step 9: We can combine steps 4, 5, and 7 to conclude that if KiKi is terricolous, it is an animal that jumps.
Step 10: Therefore, if KiKi is terricolous, Jane likes it.
Step 11: Combining steps 1 and 10, we can see that KiKi cannot be both terricolous and an animal that barks.
Step 12: Since KiKi is an animal and cannot be both terricolous and an animal that barks, it cannot be a dog.
Step 13: Therefore, KiKi is not a barking dog.

Step 8: We are given that "KiKi is an animal."
Step 9: We are also given that "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs."
Step 10: Since KiKi is an animal and either jumps or has legs (steps 5 and 6), KiKi is not terricolous.
Step 11: Since KiKi is not terricolous, Jane does not like KiKi.
Step 12: Since Jane does not like dogs and KiKi is not a dog (step 3), KiKi does not bark.
Step 13: Therefore, KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog.

1 out of 2 is correct!
Let:
    T: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events
    S: Bonnie is a student who attends the school
    Y: Bonnie is a young child or teenager
    A: Bonnie wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities
    I: Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community
    C: Bonnie chaperones high school dances
Premises:
    If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she attends and is very engaged with school events. (T → S)
    Bonnie performs in school talent shows often or is inactive and disinterested in the community. (T ∨ I)
    Bonnie chaperones high school dances is not a student who attends the school. (C → ¬S)
    All people in the club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. (I → C)
    All young children and teenagers in the club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. (Y ∧ A → S)
    Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school. (T ∧ S) ∨ (¬T ∧ ¬S)
Logical Chain:
    From (5) and (6), we know Bonnie is either T ∧ S or ¬T ∧ ¬S.
    Let's consider both possibilities:
    * If Bonnie is T ∧ S, then from (1), she performs in school talent shows often.
    * If Bonnie is ¬T ∧ ¬S, then from (2), she is inactive and disinterested in the community.
    In both cases, the conclusion is false.
Truth Table:
| T (Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events) | S (Bonnie is a student who attends the school) | Y (Bonnie is a young child or teenager) | A (Bonnie wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities) | I (Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community) | C (Bonnie chaperones high school dances) |

2 out of 3 is correct!
Let:
    M: James is a manager
    C: James has lunch in the company
    H: James has lunch at home
    R: James is working remotely
Premises:
    All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
    Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
    Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
    If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
    All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
    No managers work remotely from home.
    James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
Logical Chain:

From (7), we know that James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
From (1), if James schedules a meeting with his customers, he will go to the company building today.
From (2), if James has lunch in the company building, he schedules a meeting with his customers.
Combining (1) and (2), we can deduce that if James has lunch in the company building, he will appear in the company today.
Combining (7) and the above, we can conclude that if James is a manager, he has lunch in the company building.
From (6), if James is a manager, he does not work remotely from home.
From (4), if James has lunch at home, he is working remotely from home.
Combining (6) and (4), we can deduce that if James is a manager, he does not have lunch at home.
Combining (3) and (4), we can deduce that James has lunch in the company building.

    All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
    No managers work remotely from home.
    James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    James does not have lunch in the company (¬C)
Logical Chain:
    From (7), we know that James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
    From (6), if James is a manager, he does not work remotely from home.
    From (4), if James has lunch at home, he works remotely from home.
    Therefore, if James is a manager, he does not have lunch at home.
    From (3), James has lunch either in the company building or at home.
    Therefore, if James is a manager, he must have lunch in the company building.
    From (2), if James has lunch in the company building, he schedules meetings with his customers.
    From (1), if James schedules meetings with his customers, he will go to the company building today.
    Since we know James will appear in the company today (from 7), he must have lunch in the company building.

3 out of 5 is correct!
Let:
    M: James is a manager
    C: James is in other countries
    H: James has lunch at home
    R: James works remotely from home
Premises:
    All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
    Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
    Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
    If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
    All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
    No managers work remotely from home.
    James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries. [contrapositive is more natural]
Logical chain:
    The conclusion is a conjunction of two statements. Let's analyze each statement separately.

    **Statement 1: If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home.**
    This statement translates to ¬(M ∨ C) → ¬(H ∨ R).
    We can break this down further:
    * If M ∨ C is True, then ¬(H ∨ R) must also be True.
    * If M ∨ C is False, then ¬(H ∨ R) can be True or False.
    
    **Statement 2: If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.**
    This statement translates to (H ∨ R) → ¬(M ∧ C).
    We can break this down further:
    * If H ∨ R is True, then ¬(M ∧ C) must also be True.
    * If H ∨ R is False, then ¬(M ∧ C) can be True or False.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):

    Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey. (O)
Logical Chain:
    From (2), (3), (4), and (5), we know Tom is not any of the first four types of wild turkeys.
    Since Tom is a wild turkey (5), and the only remaining type is Ocellated, Tom must be an Ocellated wild turkey.

    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
Logical chain:
    From (6): K = True
    From (3), Rockie is either a rabbit or a squirrel.
    Let's consider two possibilities:
        - If Rockie is a rabbit:
            - From (1), if Rockie is a rabbit, then Rockie is cute.
            - From (5), if Rockie is a squirrel, then Rockie is skittish.
            - Since Rockie is calm (K = True) and skittishness is the opposite of calmness, this is a contradiction.
        - If Rockie is a squirrel:
            - From (5), if Rockie is a squirrel, then Rockie is skittish.
            - From (6), Rockie is calm.
            - This is also a contradiction.

Let:
    A: Marvin is an alien
    E: Marvin is from Earth
    M: Marvin is from Mars
Premises:
    All aliens are extraterrestrials.
    If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
    No extraterrestrials are human.
    All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
    Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
    Marvin is from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
    If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Marvin is an alien.
Logical Chain:
    From (5) and (4), we know that if Marvin is from Earth, then Marvin is a human.
    From (2) and (3), we know that if Marvin is from Mars, then Marvin is an alien.
    From (6), we know that Marvin is from Earth and Mars, or he is from neither.
    Combining (1) and (2), we know that if Marvin is an extraterrestrial, then he is not human.
    Combining (5) and (4), we know that if Marvin is a human, then he is highly intelligent.
    Therefore, if Marvin is from Earth, he is both human and highly intelligent.
    Since (1) and (3) contradict each other, it is impossible for Marvin to be both an alien and human.
    This means Marvin must be from Mars, and therefore an alien.

16 out of 28 is correct!
Let:
    A: Marvin is an alien
    E: Marvin is from Earth
    M: Marvin is from Mars
Premises:
    All aliens are extraterrestrials (A → E)
    If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien (M → A)
    No extraterrestrials are human (A → ¬H)
    All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans (E → H)
    Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
    Marvin is from Earth and Mars, or he is from neither (E ∨ ¬(E ∧ M))
    If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial (¬E → A)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars, which translates to ¬(H ∧ M)

Logical Chain:

From (5), Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
From (4), if Marvin is from Earth, then Marvin is a human (E → H).
From (3), no extraterrestrials are human (A → ¬H).
From (1), if Marvin is an alien, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial (A → E).
From (2), if Marvin is from Mars, then Marvin is an alien (M → A).
From (6), Marvin is from Earth and Mars, or he is from neither.
We need to analyze the possibilities:

- **Case 1: Marvin is from Earth and Mars (E ∧ M).**
    - From (2), Marvin is an alien (M → A).
    - From (3), if Marvin is an alien, then Marvin is not human (A → ¬H).
    - Therefore, if Marvin is from Earth and Mars, he is not human.
- **Case 2: Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars (¬(E ∧ M)).**
    - From (7), if Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial (¬E → A).
    - From (1), if Marvin is an extraterrestrial, then Marvin is not human (A → ¬H).
    - Therefore, if Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars, he is not human.

In both cases, Marvin is not human.

Logical chain:
    From (8), we know that if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid. 
    From (6), we know that if Djokovic is an athlete, then Djokovic is famous.

    I: Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine
Premises:
    M is True (Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable)
    Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine (D is True)
    C is True (Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers)
    I is True (Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    D (Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable)
Logical Chain:
    From the premises, we know that M is True.
    We also know that Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine, so D is True.

Let:
    D: Diamond Mine
    R: Roderick Strong
    C: Creed Brothers
Premises:
    D is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.
    R leads D.
    D includes C.
    Imperium has a feud with D.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    R leads C.
Logical Chain:
    The premises state that R leads D, and D includes C. 
    However, the premises do not explicitly state that R leads C specifically. 
    It is possible that R leads D as a whole, but not necessarily that R leads C individually.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| D (Diamond Mine) | R (Roderick Strong) | C (Creed Brothers) | R leads C |

Let:
    D: Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable
    I: Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine
    C: Creed Brothers are in Diamond Mine
    N: Ivy Nile is in Diamond Mine
Premises:
    Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable (D is True)
    Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine
    Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile (C and N are True)
    Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine (I is True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile. This translates to ¬I ∨ ¬(C ∧ N).
Logical Chain:
    From (1) D = True
    From (2), (3), and (4), we know that Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine (I = True).
    From (3), both C and N are True.
    Therefore, the conclusion ¬I ∨ ¬(C ∧ N) is False.

Let:
    Z: A design by Max is Zaha Hadid's design style
    K: A design by Max is Kelly Wearstler's design style
    B: A design by Max is a brutalist building
    I: A design by Max has interesting geometries
    E: A design by Max is evocative
Premises:
    If Z ∧ I, then B ∧ E
    ¬(B ∧ Z)
    Z ∨ K
    K → E
    K → D
    I → (B ∧ E)
Conclusion to Evaluate: B
Logical chain:

From (3), we know Z ∨ K must be True. 
Let's consider the two possibilities:
    - If Z is True:
        - From (1), if Z is True and I is True, then B and E must be True.
        - From (2), if Z is True, then B must be False. 
        - This creates a contradiction.
    - If K is True:
        - From (4), if K is True, then E is True.
        - From (5), if K is True, then D is True.
        - From (6), if I is True, then B and E are True.
        - Since E is already True from (4), we don't need (6).
        - Therefore, if K is True, then B is True.

Let:
    Z: Max adores a design by Zaha Hadid
    K: Max adores a design by Kelly Wearstler
    I: The design has interesting geometries
    B: The design is a brutalist building
    E: The design is evocative
    D: The design is dreamy
Premises:
    If Max adores a design, it is either Zaha Hadid's or Kelly Wearstler's. (Z ∨ K)
    All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries. (Z → I)
    No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries. (B → ¬I)
    All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative. (K → E)
    All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy. (K → D)
    If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative. (I → (B ∧ E))
Logical Chain:

From (2), if Z is True, then I must be True.
From (3), if B is True, then I must be False.
From (4), if K is True, then E must be True.
From (5), if K is True, then D must be True.
Combining (4) and (5), if K is True, then both E and D are True.
Combining (1), (2), and (3), we can see that if Z is True, then B must be False.
Therefore, if Max adores a design, it must be Kelly Wearstler's.
Since all Kelly Wearstler designs that Max adores are both evocative and dreamy (from 4 and 5), we can conclude that a design by Max is both evocative and dreamy.

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| Z (Max adores Zaha Hadid) | K (Max adores Kelly Wearstler) | I (Interesting geometries) | B (Brutalist building) | E (Evocative) | D (Dreamy) |

    I: A design by Max has interesting geometries
    B: A design by Max is a brutalist building
    E: A design by Max is evocative
    D: A design by Max is dreamy
Premises:
    If Max adores a design, then it is either Z or K.
    If Max adores a design, then it is either Z and I or K and (E ∧ D).
    All Z that Max adores have I.
    All K that Max adores are E.
    All K that Max adores are D.
    If Max adores a design, then it is either Z and B or K and (E ∧ D).
Logical chain:
    From (1), we know that Max's designs are either Z or K.
    From (2), we know that if Max adores a design, then it is either Z and I or K and (E ∧ D).
    From (3), if Z is True, then I is True.
    From (4), if K is True, then E is True.
    From (5), if K is True, then D is True.
    From (2) and (3), if Z is True, then I is True.
    From (2) and (4), if K is True, then E is True.
    From (2) and (5), if K is True, then D is True.
    Therefore, if Max adores a design, then it is either Z and I or K and (E ∧ D).
    Since E and D are both True if K is True, we can conclude that if Max adores a design, then it is either Z and I or E and D.

    All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male. (M ∨ F)
    All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal. (M → R)
    If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. (W ∨ R → ¬M)
    Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022. (G)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players. (A)
Logical chain:
    From (7), G is True.
    From (6), we know that Coco Gauff is either ranked highly by the WTA (W) or lost to Rafael Nadal (R).
    Let's consider both possibilities:
    * If W is True, then from (1), A is True.
    * If R is True, then from (5), M is False.
    * If M is False, then from (4), Coco Gauff is female.

    If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. (W → A)
    Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association. (L(Świątek) → W)
    All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek. (F → L(Świątek))
    All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male. (F ∨ M)
    All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal. (M → R)
    If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. (W ∨ R → ¬M)

Logical Chain:
    From (6) and (7), we know Coco Gauff is either ranked highly, lost to Nadal, or is a male player.
    Let's analyze each possibility:
        * **Case 1: W (Ranked highly)**
            * From (2), if Coco Gauff is ranked highly, she lost to Świątek.
            * From (3), if she lost to Świątek, she is female.
            * From (5), if she is female, she lost to Nadal.
        * **Case 2: R (Lost to Nadal)**
            * This case is already stated in the premise.
        * **Case 3: M (Male player)**

Premises:
    If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis.
    Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
    All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
    All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
    All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
    If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
    Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.
Logical chain:
    We know from (2) that if Coco Gauff lost to Iga Świątek, she is ranked highly by the WTA.
    We know from (1) that if she is ranked highly by the WTA, she is one of the most active players in major tennis.
    Therefore, if Coco Gauff lost to Iga Świątek, she is one of the most active players in major tennis.
    The conclusion states she is *not* both. This is a contradiction.

Premises:
    All cats are mammals (C → M)
    Some pets are not mammals (¬M ∨ P)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    No pets are cats (¬P → ¬C)
Logical Chain:
    The premises do not directly support the conclusion. 
    It is possible to have pets that are also cats.

Let:
    S: James's favorite season is summer
    E: Emma's favorite season is summer
    M: Mia's favorite season is summer
Premises:
    There are four seasons in a year: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. (This premise does not directly affect the conclusion)
    All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
    Emma's favorite season is summer.
    Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
    James wants to have a long vacation.
Logical chain:
    From (2) and (5), we know James wants a long vacation and therefore James's favorite season must be summer.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| S (James's favorite season is summer) | E (Emma's favorite season is summer) | M (Mia's favorite season is summer) |

Let:
    S: Mia's favorite season is Summer
    E: Emma's favorite season is Summer
    F: Mia's favorite season is Fall
    W: Mia's favorite season is Winter
Premises:
    There are four seasons in a year: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter.
    All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
    Emma's favorite season is summer.
    Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
    James wants to have a long vacation.
Logical Chain:
    From (3), E is True.
    From (2) and (3), if Mia wants a long vacation, then Mia's favorite season must be Summer.
    From (4), Mia's favorite season is not Summer.
    Therefore, Mia's favorite season must be either Fall or Winter.

Premises:
    ¬(D ∧ P)
    P → D
    S → D
    H → P
    (S → H) → P
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    P
Logical Chain:
    From (2) and (5), we know that if 1984 is a streaming service (S), then it is digital (D).
    From (4), if 1984 is a hardcover book (H), then it is printed (P).
    From (1), we know that 1984 is not both digital and printed.
    Therefore, 1984 cannot be both a streaming service and a hardcover book.
    Since 1984 cannot be both, it cannot be printed.
Truth Table:
| D (Digital) | P (Printed) | S (Streaming) | H (Hardcover) |

Let:
    D: 1984 is digital media
    A: 1984 is analog media
    S: 1984 is a streaming service
    H: 1984 is a hardcover book
Premises:
    ¬(D ∧ A) (No digital media are analog)
    A → H (Every printed text is analog)
    S → D (All streaming services are digital)
    H → A (If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text)
    S → H (If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book)
Logical Chain:
    From (4) and (5), we can deduce that if 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.
    From (2), if 1984 is a hardcover book, then 1984 is analog.
    From (1), if 1984 is analog, then 1984 cannot be digital.
    Therefore, if 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be both analog and digital.
    This creates a contradiction, meaning 1984 cannot be a streaming service.
Truth Table:

    H → A (If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text)
    S → H (If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book)
Conclusion to Evaluate: ¬S (1984 is not a streaming service)
Logical Chain:
    From (4) and (5), if S is True, then H must be True.
    From (2), if H is True, then A must be True.
    From (1), if A is True, then D must be False.
    Therefore, if S is True, then D is False, which contradicts (3).
    This means S must be False.

    Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US. (C)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Mike has an F1 visa (F)
Logical chain:
    From (3), we know Mike is an international student.
    From (4), we know Mike needs to apply for CPT.
    From (2), if Mike had an F1 visa, he would need to apply for CPT. 
    Therefore, Mike could have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.

Let:
    F: Mike has an F1 visa
    J: Mike has a J1 visa
    C: Mike applies for CPT
Premises:
    All international students in the US have an F1 or J1 visa (F ∨ J)
    If Mike is an international student in the US with an F1 visa, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT (F → C)
    Mike is an international student (Mike is in the US)
    Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US (C)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Mike has a J1 visa (J)
Logical Chain:
    From (2) and (3), we know Mike has an F1 visa or a J1 visa (F ∨ J).
    From (4), we know Mike needs to apply for CPT.
    We don't have enough information to determine if Mike has an F1 or a J1 visa.

    Ted is an alligator (T is an alligator)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), T is an alligator, and from (4), alligators are not domesticated animals. 
    Therefore, Ted is not a domesticated animal.
    From (2), we know there exists at least one pet that is Brown Swiss cattle, but we don't know if it's Ted.

Let:
    I: Tom's license plate is from Istanbul
    B34: Tom's license plate begins with 34
    B35: Tom's license plate begins with 35
Premises:
    All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34. (B34 → I)
    Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul. (¬B34 → ¬I)
    Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. (I is True)
    Tom's license plate begins with the number 35. (B35 is True)
    If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34. (B35 → ¬B34)
Logical Chain:
    From (4), B35 is True.
    From (5), if B35 is True, then B34 must be False.
    From (2), if B34 is False, then I must be False.
Truth Table (for Tom's license plate):
| B34 (Tom's plate begins with 34) | B35 (Tom's plate begins with 35) | I (Tom's plate is from Istanbul) |

    C: Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes
    M: Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa
    S: Dried Thai chilies are spicy
    H: Dried Thai chilies are mala hotpots

Premises:
    ¬(B ∧ S) (No baked sweets are spicy)
    C → B (All cupcakes are baked sweets)
    H → S (All mala hotpots are spicy)
    M → C (All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes)
    S ∨ H ∨ ¬B (Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets)

Logical chain:
    We know from (4) that if M is True, then C is True.
    We also know from (3) that if H is True, then S is True.
    Combining these two premises, we can see that if M is True, then S is True.
    However, we also know from (1) that B ∧ S is False.
    Therefore, if M is True, then B must be False.
    This contradicts (4), so M cannot be True.

Conclusion to Evaluate:
    ¬(B ∧ D)
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if D is a cupcake, then it is also a product of Baked by Melissa.
    From (3), if D is spicy, then it is a mala hotpot.
    From (4), if D is not a cupcake, then it is either a mala hotpot or not spicy.
    Combining (2) and (3), if D is a cupcake, then it is a mala hotpot.
    This contradicts (4), so there is no overlap between cupcakes and dried Thai chilies.
    Therefore, if D is a cupcake, then it cannot be a dried Thai chili.
    This means that if D is a dried Thai chili, then it cannot be a cupcake, and therefore not a product of Baked by Melissa.

Let:
    R: Restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations
    T: Restaurant provides take-out service
    N: Restaurant receives many negative reviews
    G: Restaurant has a rating greater than 4
    L: Restaurant is popular among local residents
Premises:
    If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews. (R → ¬N)
    All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations. (G → R)
    Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. (¬T → N)
    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four. (L → G)
    The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. (G ∨ L)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service.
Logical Chain:
    We need to analyze the truth value of the following statement:
    (T ∧ N) → (G ∧ ¬T)
    This translates to:
    If T ∧ N is True, then G ∧ ¬T must be True.
    Let's break down the possibilities:
    * If T ∧ N is True, then T is True and N is True.
    * If T is True and N is True, then we can't conclude that G is True. 
    * If T is True and N is True, then we can't conclude that ¬T is True.

Let:
    R: The Hamden Plaza Subway store is listed in Yelp’s recommendations
    N: The Hamden Plaza Subway store has received many negative reviews
    T: The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service
    G: The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four
    L: The Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents
Premises:
    If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews. (R → ¬N)
    All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations. (G → R)
    Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. (¬T → N)
    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four. (L → G)
    The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. (G ∨ L)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews. (T ∨ ¬N)

Logical Chain:
    From (4) and (5), we know that either G is True or L is True.
    Let's consider two possibilities:
    * If G is True, then from (2), R is True, and from (1), if R is True, then ¬N is True.
    * If L is True, then from (4), G is True, and we know from (2) that R is True, and from (1), if R is True, then ¬N is True.
    In both cases, we see that if G is True or L is True, then ¬N is True.
    Therefore, regardless of whether T is True or False, the Hamden Plaza Subway store does not receive many negative reviews.
Truth Table:
| R (Listed in Yelp's recommendations) | N (Received many negative reviews) | T (Provides take-out service) | G (Rating greater than four) | L (Popular among local residents) |

Let:
    R: The Hamden Plaza store is listed in Yelp’s recommendations
    T: The Hamden Plaza store provides take-out service
    N: The Hamden Plaza store receives many negative reviews
    Y: The Hamden Plaza store has a rating greater than four
    L: The Hamden Plaza store is popular among local residents
Premises:
    If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews. (R → ¬N)
    All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations. (Y → R)
    Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. (¬T → N)
    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four. (L → Y)
    The Hamden Plaza store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. (Y ∨ L)
Logical Chain:
    We need to determine if ¬T is True. 
    From (4) and (5), we can derive that either Y is True or L is True.
    If Y is True, then R is True (from 2).
    If R is True, then ¬N is True (from 1).
    Therefore, if Y is True, then ¬N is True.
    If L is True, then Y is True, and we know from the above that if Y is True, then ¬N is True.
    Therefore, in both cases (Y is True or L is True), ¬N is True.
    Since ¬N is True, we cannot definitively say that ¬T is True.

    A: Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy
    D: The security deposit is no more than $1500
Premises:
    Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
    A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
    The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
    Fluffy is Tom's cat.
    Cats are pets.
    The Olive Garden is a managed building.
    The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
    $2000 is more than $1500.
    Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
    If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden (P)
Logical chain:
    From (5), (6), and (7), we know Fluffy is a pet.
    From (8), we know that if The Olive Garden allows pets, Tom can move in with Fluffy.
    From (9), if Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy, he will rent an apartment in a managed building if the security deposit is no more than $1500.
    From (7), the security deposit is $2000, which is more than $1500.
    Therefore, Tom will not rent an apartment in The Olive Garden.

    The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
    Fluffy is Tom's cat.
    Cats are pets.
    The Olive Garden is a managed building.
    The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
    $2000 is more than $1500.
    Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
    If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
Logical chain:
    From (6) and (9), we know that if M is True, then Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy.
    From (5), we know that Fluffy is a pet.
    From (4), we know that The Olive Garden is a managed building.
    From (7), we know that the monthly rent at The Olive Garden is $2000.
    From (8), we know that $2000 is more than $1500.

    All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
    All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
    All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
    All queen bees are bees.
    Harry is a bee.
Logical chain:
    From (5) and (6), we know Harry is a bee.
    From (4), we know Harry does not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
    From (1), we know Harry is either a vertebrate or an invertebrate.
    From (3), if Harry were a vertebrate, then Harry would have a backbone.
    From (2), if Harry had a backbone, then Harry would reproduce by male-and-female mating, which contradicts (4).
    Therefore, Harry cannot be a vertebrate.
    Since Harry is a bee (5) and not a vertebrate (7), Harry is an invertebrate.
    Since Harry is a bee (5), Harry is not a queen bee.

Let:

    S: Luke has siblings
    H: Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings
    L: Luke lives at home
    Str: Luke lives with strangers
Premises:
    If people are born in a multiple birth with siblings, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings (M ∧ S → H)
    If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth (S → M)
    If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together (¬H → ¬S)
    If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers (L → ¬Str)
    If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home (H → L)
    Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers (M ∧ Str) ∨ (¬M ∧ ¬Str)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings (H)
Logical Chain:

From (5), if H is True, then L must be True.
From (4), if L is True, then ¬Str must be True.
From (2), if S is True, then M must be True.
From (1), if M is True and S is True, then H must be True.
From (6), we know Luke is either (M ∧ Str) or (¬M ∧ ¬Str). 
Let's consider both possibilities:
    - If M ∧ Str is True:
        - From (2), S must be True.
        - From (1), if M is True and S is True, then H must be True.
    - If ¬M ∧ ¬Str is True:
        - From (3), if ¬H is True, then ¬S must be True.
        - From (4), if ¬H is True, then ¬L must be True.
        - From (5), if ¬L is True, then ¬Str must be False.
        - This contradicts our initial assumption of ¬Str being True. Therefore, this branch is not valid.

Let:
    M: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth
    S: Luke has siblings
    H: Luke lives at home
    C: Luke complains often about annoying siblings
Premises:
    If people who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings. (M ∧ S → H)
    If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth. (S → M)
    If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together. (C → S)
    If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers. (H → ¬S)
    If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. (M ∧ S → H)
    Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. (M ∧ ¬S) ∨ (¬M ∧ S)
Logical Chain:
    We know from (6) that Luke is either M ∧ ¬S or ¬M ∧ S.
    Let's consider each possibility:
    - If M ∧ ¬S is True, then from (2) S would be False, which contradicts (6).
    - If ¬M ∧ S is True, then from (1), H would be False.
    - In both cases, we see that Luke does not live at home.
    - Since Luke does not live at home, from (4), he does not live with strangers.
    - Since Luke does not live with strangers, from (3), he does not complain about annoying siblings.

    If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. (H → H)
    Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. (M ∧ L) ∨ (¬M ∧ ¬L)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know M ∧ L is True or ¬M ∧ ¬L is True.
    Let's consider both possibilities:
    * **If M ∧ L is True:**
        * From (2), if M is True, then S is True.
        * From (3), if S is True, then A is True.
        * From (5), if H is True, then A is True.
        * From (6), if M is True, then H must be True.
        * Therefore, if M ∧ L is True, then A must be True.
    * **If ¬M ∧ ¬L is True:**
        * From (2), if M is False, then S is False.
        * From (3), if S is False, then A is False.
        * From (6), if ¬M is True, then ¬L must be True.
        * Therefore, if ¬M ∧ ¬L is True, then A must be False.
Truth Table:
| M (Born in multiple birth) | S (Siblings born together) | A (Complains often) | H (Lives at home) | L (Lives with strangers) |

Let:
    S: Tom lives in a single-parent family
    R: Tom has few resources available
    H: Tom proves economic hardship
    F: Tom is provided financial aid
Premises:
    GRE test costs $205, cheaper than $300 (This premise is irrelevant to the conclusion)
    ETS provides financial aid to those who prove economic hardship.
    Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available can prove economic hardship.
    Tom lives in a single-parent family.
    Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.
    Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    ETS provides financial aid to Tom.
Logical Chain:
    From (4), S = True
    From (5), R = True
    From (3), if S ∨ R is True, then H is True
    Since both S and R are True, H is True
    From (2), if H is True, then F is True

    S: Tom lives in a single-parent family
    R: Tom has few resources
    E: Tom is applying to take the GRE test
    F: ETS provides financial aid to Tom
Premises:
    The cost of the GRE test is $205, which is cheaper than $300. (This premise does not directly relate to financial aid)
    ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
    Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
    Tom lives in a single-parent family.
    Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.
    Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something.
Logical chain:
    From (2), if Tom proves economic hardship, ETS provides financial aid.
    From (3), if Tom lives in a single-parent family or has few resources, Tom can prove economic hardship.
    From (4) and (5), Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources.
    Therefore, Tom can prove economic hardship.
    Therefore, ETS provides financial aid to Tom (F = True).
    This contradicts the conclusion that no one taking the GRE test has financial aid.

Let:
    F: People spill a lot of food on their clothing
    C: People are cleanly
    O: People value order and spotlessness
Premises:
    If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
    All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
    If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
    If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
    All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
    Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Peter is notably tidy.
Logical Chain:
    From (5), if Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, then he is notably tidy (from 3).
    From (4), if Peter values order and spotlessness, then he is cleanly.
    From (5), Peter is either (F ∧ C) or (¬F ∧ ¬C).
    If Peter is (F ∧ C), then he is notably tidy.

Let:
    F: Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing
    C: Peter is clumsy
    O: Peter values order and spotlessness
    D: Peter goes out frequently to find new food restaurants
    H: Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness
Premises:
    If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy. (¬(F → ¬T))
    All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. (C ∧ D → F)
    If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy. (C → T)
    If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly. (O → C)
    All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness. (H → O)
    Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. (F ∧ C) ∨ (¬F ∧ ¬C)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know Peter is either F ∧ C or ¬F ∧ ¬C.
    Let's analyze both possibilities:
    - **Case 1: F ∧ C**
        - From (3), if C is True, then Peter is Tidy.
        - From (1), if F is True, then Peter is not Tidy.
        - This creates a contradiction.
    - **Case 2: ¬F ∧ ¬C**
        - From (5), if H is True, then O is True.
        - From (4), if O is True, then C is True.
        - From (3), if C is True, then Peter is Tidy.
        - From (1), if F is False, then Peter is Tidy.
        - In this case, Peter is Tidy regardless of H.

Truth Table (for Peter):

Let:
    C: Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing
    F: Peter is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try
    O: Peter values order and spotlessness
    H: Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness
Premises:
    If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
    All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
    If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
    If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
    All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
    Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.
Logical Chain:
    From (5) if Peter's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then Peter values order and spotlessness.
    From (4), if Peter values order and spotlessness, then Peter is cleanly.
    From (3), if Peter is cleanly, then Peter is notably tidy.
    From (1), if Peter is notably tidy, then Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing.
    Combining (2) and (1), we can see that Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie and notably tidy.
    Therefore, Peter must be either a clumsy foodie or notably tidy.
    Since Peter is either a clumsy foodie or notably tidy, he cannot be both.
    This means Peter is neither a clumsy foodie nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.

Premises:
    All fir trees are evergreens. (F → E)
    Some objects of worship are fir trees. (∃x (O(x) ∧ F(x)))
Logical chain:
    From the second premise, we know there exists at least one object that is both a fir tree and an object of worship. 
    However, this doesn't mean that *all* fir trees are objects of worship.
    Therefore, there could be fir trees that are not objects of worship.

Logical Chain:

From (2), we know P is True.
From (1), we know M ∨ T must be True.
From (3), we know H is True.
From (4), if T were True, then H would be False, which contradicts our knowledge that H is True.
Therefore, T must be False.
Since M ∨ T is True and T is False, M must be True.
Therefore, P ∧ M is True.

Premises:
    The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas. (P ∨ T)
    Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains. (This premise does not directly affect the location of the mine)
    The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated. (P is True)
    There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines that have been donated. (¬T → ¬M)

Logical Chain:
    From (3), P is True.
    From (1), either P is True and N is True, or P is True and T is True.
    If P is True and N is True, then M is True.

Premises:
    If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
    Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class (C is True)
    If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z.
    Peter is a man who is taller than Michael (T is True)
    Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
    Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.

    If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z.
    Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
    Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
    Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
    Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
Logical Chain:
    From (4), Peter is taller than Michael.
    From (2), Michael is taller than everyone else in his class, so Michael is taller than Peter.
    This creates a contradiction, meaning the premises are inconsistent.
    Since the premises are inconsistent, we cannot definitively say anything about Windy's shooting ability.

Let:
    M: Michael
    P: Peter
    W: Windy
    J: Jump when shooting
Premises:
    If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
    Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
    If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z.
    Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
    Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
    Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
    Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Peter can block Windy's shooting.

Logical Chain:
    From (2), M is taller than everyone else.
    From (4), P is taller than M.
    From (3), if P is taller than M and M is taller than everyone else, then P is taller than everyone else.
    From (5), if P is taller than everyone else, then P can block everyone's shooting.
    From (6), M cannot block W's shooting.
    We don't know if W can jump.
    If W can jump, then W is a great shooter (7).
    If W can jump, then P can block W's shooting (5).
    If W cannot jump, then P can block W's shooting (5).

Let:
    B: Barutin Cove
    S: Snow Island
    G: Greenwich Island
    D: Deception Island
    A: Antarctica
Premises:
    B is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. (This premise does not directly relate to location)
    B is on the southwest coast of S.
    S, G, and D are located in the South Shetland Islands.
    A is located in the South Shetland Islands.
    If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.
Logical Chain:
    From (2), B is located on S.
    From (3), S is located in South Shetland Islands.
    From (4), A is located in South Shetland Islands.
    From (5), if B is in S and S is in South Shetland Islands, then B is in South Shetland Islands.
    Therefore, B is in South Shetland Islands.
    From (4), A is in South Shetland Islands.
    Since B and A are both in South Shetland Islands, we cannot definitively say that B is not in A.

Let:
    T: John's car is a Tesla Model 3
    S: John's car is a single-seat electric car
Premises:
    If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
    All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
    All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
    All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
    If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
Logical chain:
    From (2) and (3), if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a one-seater.
    From (4) and (3), if John's car is a single-seat electric car, then it is a one-seater.
    From (1), if John's car is not a one-seater, then it cannot be a single-seat electric car.
    Combining (2) and (3), we see that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, then it cannot be a single-seat electric car.
    From (5), if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it cannot be a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
    Therefore, the only way John's car can be a Tesla Model 3 is if it is a Tesla Model 3 and a single-seat electric car, which contradicts our previous reasoning.

Let:
    E: John is engaged
    W: John has a well-attended wedding
    F: John invites friends to their ceremony
    L: John has a larger family
Premises:
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬F ∧ ¬W)
    All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged. (W → E)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (W → F)
    Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families. (∃x (W(x) ∧ L(x)))
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (L → (W ∨ F))
Logical chain:
    We know from (4) that there exists at least one person who has a well-attended wedding and a larger family. 
    However, this doesn't directly imply anything about whether or not John has a larger family.
    We can analyze the premises to see if we can deduce anything specific about John:
    - If John is engaged (E is True), then John does not invite friends (¬F) and does not make wedding plans (¬W).
    - If John is not engaged, then John may or may not have a well-attended wedding (W can be True or False).
    - If John has a well-attended wedding, then John invites friends (F is True).
    - If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding (W is True) or invites friends (F is True).

    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬(F ∧ W))
    All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged. (W → E)
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (F → W)
    Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families. (Some L)
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (L → (W ∨ F))
Conclusion to Evaluate: John does not have a larger family, which translates to ¬L
Logical Chain:
    From (1), if John is engaged, then John does not make wedding plans and does not invite friends.
    From (2), if John makes wedding plans, then John is engaged.
    From (3), if John invites friends to their ceremony, then John makes wedding plans.
    Therefore, if John is engaged, then John does not invite friends and does not make wedding plans.
    From (4), we know there are some people with larger families who have well-attended weddings.
    From (5), if John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends.
    Since John is engaged (from 1), John does not make wedding plans or invite friends (from 1).
    Therefore, if John has a larger family, then John does not have a well-attended wedding (from 5).
    This contradicts (4), so John cannot have a larger family.

    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans (F → E)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony (W → F)
    Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families. (There exists a person with W and L)
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬F ∧ ¬W)
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (L → (W ∨ F))
Conclusion to Evaluate: John is engaged (E)
Logical Chain:
    We need to determine if E is True. 
    From (5), if E were True, then both F and W would be False.
    This contradicts (2), which states that if John invites others to their ceremony (F), then John is engaged (E).
    Therefore, if John is engaged (E), then John cannot be engaged (E). This is a contradiction.

    U: Unsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model
    R: Reinforcement learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model
Premises:
    Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
    Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
    The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
    Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
    The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Supervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model (S)
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if U were True, then the model would not require labeled data.
    From (5), the model does require labeled data.
    Therefore, U must be False.
    From (3), the model is trained with a machine learning algorithm.
    From (1), this means the model is trained with either S or R.
    From (4), R is False.
    Therefore, S must be True.

    U: The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with unsupervised learning
    R: The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with reinforcement learning
Premises:
    Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
    Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
    The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
    Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
    The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.
Logical Chain:
    From (3), we know the state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning.
    From (4), we know reinforcement learning is not used to train the model.
    From (5), we know the machine learning algorithm used requires labeled data.
    From (2), if the model used unsupervised learning, it would not require labeled data.
    Therefore, the model cannot be trained with unsupervised learning.

Let:
    F: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a film in the "Frozen" series
    E: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content
    A: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages
Premises:
    If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
    If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
    If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
    All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
    All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
    "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a film.
    "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages.
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a film.
    From (7), we know "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages.
    Let's consider two possibilities:
    - If "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film, then from (4) it is rated General Audience.
    - If "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages, then from (3) it is rated General Audience.
    Therefore, in both cases, "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is rated General Audience.
    From (5), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is in the "Frozen" series, then it is a family-friendly animated film.
    Therefore, if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is in the "Frozen" series, it is rated General Audience.
    From (2), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content, then it cannot be watched by children without guidance.
    From (1), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance.
    Therefore, if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages, it does not contain excessive erotic and violent content.
    Combining the above, we see that if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is in the "Frozen" series, it is rated General Audience and does not contain excessive erotic and violent content.
    Therefore, the statement "Hachi: A dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series is true.

    If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States.
    A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship.
    No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship.
    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom.
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom.
Logical Chain:
    From (1) and (2), if someone has United States citizenship, they can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.
    From (3), Ekaterina has either United States citizenship (C) or Taiwanese citizenship (T).
    From (4), if Ekaterina has Taiwanese citizenship, then she cannot be a Russian Federation official (R).
    From (5), Vladimir is neither Taiwanese (T) nor a manager at Gazprom (G).
    From (6), Ekaterina can either register to vote in the United States or be a Russian Federation official (R).
    Combining (1), (2), and (6), we can conclude that Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election if she has United States citizenship.
    Combining (6) and (4), we can conclude that Ekaterina cannot be both Taiwanese and a Russian Federation official.
    Since Vladimir is neither Taiwanese nor a manager at Gazprom, he cannot be a Russian Federation official.
    Therefore, Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom is True.

    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom. (¬T ∧ ¬G)
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official. (U ∨ R)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.
    This translates to ¬(U ∧ V)
Logical Chain:
    From (4), we know ¬T ∧ ¬G is True.

    From (1), if Ekaterina has United States citizenship, then she can register to vote in the United States.
    From (5), if Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, then R must be False.
    Therefore, Ekaterina cannot register to vote in the United States.
    From (4), Vladimir does not have United States citizenship.

106 out of 152 is correct!
Let:
    H: The mixture is a hydrocarbon
    A: The mixture is an alkane
    C: The mixture contains carbon
Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds (H → O)
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons (A → H)
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds (O → Ch)
    All organic compounds contain carbon (O → C)
    No chemical compounds contain only one element (¬Ch → ¬O)
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither (Ch ∧ ¬O) ∨ ¬(Ch ∧ O)
Logical Chain:
    From (2) and (1), we know that if the mixture is an alkane (A), then it is a hydrocarbon (H).
    From (3), if the mixture is a hydrocarbon (H), then it is an organic compound (O).
    From (4), if the mixture is an organic compound (O), then it contains carbon (C).
    Therefore, if the mixture is an alkane (A), then it contains carbon (C).
    However, the premises do not guarantee that the mixture is an alkane. 
    The final premise (5) introduces the possibility that the mixture is not a chemical compound or contains only one element. 
    In this case, the mixture may or may not contain carbon.

    C: The mixture contains carbon
    A: The mixture is an alkane
Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds (H → O)
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons (A → H)
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds (O → C)
    All organic compounds contain carbon (O → C)
    No chemical compounds contain only one element (¬C → ¬O)
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. (C ∧ ¬O) ∨ ¬(C ∧ O)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon (A ∧ C)
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if A is True, then H is True.
    From (1), if H is True, then O is True.
    From (3), if O is True, then C is True.
    Therefore, if A is True, then C is True.

Let:
    C: The mixture contains carbon
    H: The mixture is a hydrocarbon
    O: The mixture is an organic compound
    Ch: The mixture is a chemical compound
Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds. (H → O)
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons. (A → H)
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds. (O → Ch)
    All organic compounds contain carbon. (O → C)
    No chemical compounds contain only one element. (¬(Ch ∧ 1))
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. (Ch ∧ 1) ∨ ¬(Ch ∧ 1)
Logical chain:
    From (5), if the mixture is a chemical compound, it cannot contain only one element.
    From (4), if the mixture is an organic compound, it contains carbon.
    From (2), if the mixture is an alkane, it is a hydrocarbon.
    From (1), if the mixture is a hydrocarbon, it is an organic compound.
    Combining (2), (1), and (4), we can conclude that if the mixture is an alkane, it contains carbon.
    Therefore, if the mixture is an alkane, it cannot contain only one element (contradiction with 5).
    This means the mixture cannot be both an alkane and contain only one element.
    Since the mixture cannot be both an alkane and contain only one element, it cannot be a chemical compound (contradiction with 3).
    Therefore, if the mixture contains carbon, it cannot be an alkane or a chemical compound.

Premises:
    All humans are mortal (H → M)
    All Greeks are humans (G → H)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Some Greeks are mortal (∃x (G(x) ∧ M(x)))

Logical Chain:
    From (2), if someone is a Greek, they are a human.
    From (1), if someone is a human, they are mortal.
    Therefore, if someone is a Greek, they are mortal.
    This means there exists at least one Greek who is mortal.

    P → L
    C → D
    D → D_P
    L → D_P
    L ∧ ¬(L ∨ P)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    P
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know that L ∧ ¬(L ∨ P) is True.
    From (5), if L were True, then D_P would be True.
    From (3), if C were True, then D would be True.
    From (4), if D were True, then D_P would be True.
    Since D_P is True, and we know from (5) that if L were True then D_P would be True, we can conclude that L must be True.

Let:
    M: George likes music
    P: George has access to a program
    C: George can compose
    W: George wants to compose
    G: George will compose
Premises:
    If George likes music, he wants to compose. (M → W)
    If George has access to a program, he can compose. (P → C)
    If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose. (C ∧ W → G)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If George will not compose, George can not compose. (¬G → ¬C)

Logical chain:
    We know from (3) that if George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.
    Therefore, if George will not compose (¬G), it means he either does not want to compose (¬W) or cannot compose (¬C).
    From (2), if George cannot compose (¬C), then he does not have access to a program.
    From (1), if George does not have access to a program, then he does not like music.
    Therefore, if George will not compose (¬G), he cannot compose (¬C).

    M: Breaking Bad airs at 8 pm on Monday
Premises:
    Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
    If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
    The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
    All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
    Breaking Bad is a show.
    Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

    From (5) we know B is True.
    From (6) we know B is False.
    From (1), we know there exists a show airing at 8 pm on Monday that gives out roses.
    From (2), if a show gives out roses, then it is an episode of The Bachelor.
    From (3), The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
    From (4), if a show portrays the lives of real people, then it is a reality TV show.

    T: Show is a reality TV show
Premises:
    Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
    If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
    The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
    All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
    Breaking Bad is a show.
    Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm, which translates to R ∧ B → M
Logical Chain:
    From (5), B is True.
    From (6), T is False.
    From (2), if R were True, then B would be True, which we already know.

    S: Something is a severe cancer
    B: Something is bile duct cancer
    C: Something is colorectal cancer
    L: Something comes with a low survival rate
Premises:
    If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate (D → L)
    Severe cancers are deadly diseases (S → D)
    Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer (B → S)
    All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer (B → C)
    Mild flu comes with a low survival rate (M → L)
    Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate (¬(B ∧ L))
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer (C → S)
Logical Chain:

From (2) and (3), we know that if something is a severe cancer, it is a deadly disease. 
From (1), if something is a deadly disease, it comes with a low survival rate. 
Therefore, if something is a severe cancer, it comes with a low survival rate.
From (6), we know that colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate. 
From (3), if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then it is a severe cancer. 
Since colorectal cancer is not with a low survival rate, it cannot be a bile duct cancer. 
Therefore, colorectal cancer is not a kind of severe cancer.

Let:
    D: Deadly disease
    S: Severe cancer
    B: Bile duct cancer
    C: Cholangiocarcinoma
    M: Mild flu
Premises:
    If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. (D → M)
    Severe cancers are deadly diseases. (S → D)
    Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer. (B ⊆ S)
    All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. (C ⊆ B)
    Mild flu comes with a low survival rate. (M)
    Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate. (¬(B ∧ M))
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu.
    This translates to (B ∨ C) → (B ∧ M)
Logical Chain:
    We need to analyze the truth value of the conclusion. 
    
    * **Case 1: B ∨ C is True**
        * If B ∨ C is True, then either B is True or C is True.
        * If B is True, then from (2) and (3), we know that S is True.
        * If S is True, then from (1) we know that D is True.
        * If D is True, then from (5) we know that M is True.
        * Therefore, if B is True, then B ∧ M is True.
        * If C is True, then from (4) we know that B is True.
        * If B is True, then the conclusion is True.
    * **Case 2: B ∨ C is False**
        * If B ∨ C is False, then both B and C are False.
        * Therefore, B ∧ M is False.
        * The conclusion is False.

Premises:
    If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. (D → LR)
    Severe cancers are deadly diseases. (C → D)
    Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. (B → C)
    All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. (Ch → B)
    Mild flu comes with a low survival rate. (M → LR)
    Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate. (¬(B ∧ LR))

    From (3), if B is True, then C is True.
    From (2), if C is True, then D is True.
    From (1), if D is True, then LR is True.
    From (6), if B is True, then LR is False.
    From (5), if M is True, then LR is True.
    We know that B and LR are contradictory.
    Therefore, B must be False.
    From (4), if B is False, then Ch is False.
    Therefore, Ch is False.

Let:
    S: Taylor eats salads regularly
    H: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home
    D: Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes
    P: Taylor disregards her physical well-being
Premises:
    If Taylor eats salads regularly, then she is very conscious about her health and eating habits.
    If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she eats salads regularly.
    If Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, then she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
    If Taylor disregards her physical well-being, then she is not very conscious about her health and eating habits.
    If Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she always fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.
    Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being, or she did neither.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Taylor eats salads regularly.
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she eats salads regularly.
    From (3), if Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, then she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
    From (4), if Taylor disregards her physical well-being, then she is not very conscious about her health and eating habits.
    From (1), if Taylor eats salads regularly, then she is very conscious about her health and eating habits.
    Combining (2), (3), and (1), we can conclude that if Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, then she eats salads regularly.
    From (5), if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she always fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.
    Combining (2), (3), and (5), we can conclude that if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she eats salads regularly.
    From (6), Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being, or she did neither.
    This means Taylor either satisfies the conditions for (2) and (4) or she satisfies neither.
    Therefore, Taylor either eats salads regularly or she does not.

Let:
    S: Taylor eats salads regularly
    H: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home
    N: Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes
    G: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day
    P: Taylor disregards her physical well-being
Premises:
    All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits. (S → H)
    All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly. (H → S)
    All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes. (N → H)
    All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits. (P → ¬H)
    If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes. (G → N)
    Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither. (H ∧ P) ∨ ¬(H ∧ P)

Logical Chain:

From (6), we know that Taylor either has both H and P, or neither. 
Let's consider both possibilities:
* **Case 1: Taylor has both H and P.**
    From (2), if Taylor has H, then she eats salads (S).
    From (1), if Taylor eats salads (S), then she is very conscious about her health and eating habits.
    From (4), if Taylor is very conscious about her health and eating habits, then she does not disregard her physical well-being (P). 
    This contradicts our initial assumption that Taylor has both H and P. 
* **Case 2: Taylor has neither H nor P.**
    From (5), if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day (G), then she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes (N).
    From (3), if Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes (N), then she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home (H).
    From (2), if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home (H), then she eats salads (S).
    From (1), if Taylor eats salads (S), then she is very conscious about her health and eating habits.
    From (4), if Taylor is very conscious about her health and eating habits, then she does not disregard her physical well-being (P).
    This leads to the conclusion that Taylor does not disregard her physical well-being (P).
    However, this contradicts our initial assumption that Taylor has neither H nor P.

Let:
    H: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home
    G: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day
Premises:
    If Taylor eats salads regularly, she is very conscious about her health and eating habits.
    If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she eats salads regularly.
    If Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
    If Taylor disregards her physical well-being, she is not very conscious about her health and eating habits.
    If Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.
    Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being, or she did neither.
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know that Taylor either has both H and ¬G or neither.
    Let's consider the two possibilities:
    * If Taylor has both H and ¬G:
        * From (2), if she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she eats salads regularly.
        * From (1), if she eats salads regularly, she is very conscious about her health and eating habits.
        * This contradicts (4), as we know that if she disregards her physical well-being, she is not very conscious about her health and eating habits.
        * Therefore, if Taylor has both H and ¬G, the premises are inconsistent.
    * If Taylor has neither H nor G:
        * From (5), if she visits the gym at least once a day, she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.
        * From (3), if she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
        * This contradicts our assumption that she has neither H nor G.
    Since both possibilities lead to contradictions, the premises are inconsistent.

Let:
    G: Tom is a grumpy person
    A: Tom is mean to animals
    N: Tom is nice to animals
    L: Tom is an animal lover
    P: Tom is a pet owner

Premises:
    ¬(G ∧ A) → ¬(G ∨ L)
    Some grumpy people are mean to animals (∃x (G(x) ∧ A(x)))
    All animal lovers are nice to animals (L → N)
    All pet owners love animals (P → L)
    Tom is a pet owner (P is True)
Logical Chain:

From (4), P = True.
From (3), if Tom is a pet owner, then Tom is an animal lover (L = True).
From (2), there exists at least one person who is both grumpy and mean to animals. However, we don't know if Tom is that person.
From (1), if Tom is not both grumpy and mean to animals, then Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover.

    A: Yuri is an American national
    B: Yuri is a professional basketball player
    J: Yuri can do jump shots
    L: Yuri leaps straight into the air
    M: Yuri activates his leg muscles
Premises:
    Some professional basketball players are not American nationals. (¬∀B → ¬A)
    All professional basketball players can do jump shots. (B → J)
    If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (J → L)
    If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L → M)
    Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (¬M)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Yuri is an American national (A)
Logical Chain:
    From (4) and (5), we know Yuri does not activate his leg muscles (¬M).
    From (3), if Yuri did activate his leg muscles (M), he would have leaped straight into the air (L).
    Therefore, Yuri does not leap straight into the air (¬L).
    From (2), if Yuri could do jump shots (J), he would leap straight into the air (L).
    Therefore, Yuri cannot do jump shots (¬J).
    From (1), we know that there are professional basketball players who are not American nationals.
    Since Yuri cannot do jump shots (¬J), he cannot be a professional basketball player (¬B).
    Therefore, Yuri is not an American national (¬A).

    If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (J → L)
    If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L → M)
    Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (¬M)
Conclusion to Evaluate: Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, which translates to ¬(A ∧ B).

Logical Chain:
    From (4), if Yuri does not activate his leg muscles (¬M), then he cannot leap straight into the air (¬L).
    From (3), if Yuri cannot leap straight into the air (¬L), then he cannot do jump shots (¬J).
    From (2), if Yuri cannot do jump shots (¬J), then he is not a professional basketball player (¬B).

Let:
    H: An event is happy
    S: An event is sad
Premises:
    All events are either happy or sad (H ∨ S)
    At least one event is happy (¬(¬H))
Logical Chain:
    The second premise states that there exists at least one happy event.
    This doesn't mean all events are happy, just that some are.
    It's possible that there are also sad events.
Truth Table:
| H (Happy) | S (Sad) | H ∨ S (Either Happy or Sad) | ¬(¬H) (At least one happy) |

Let:
    B: KiKi is an animal that barks
    L: KiKi has legs
    T: KiKi is terricolous
Premises:
    ¬(Jane likes B)
    All dogs are B
    Jane likes all animals that jump
    If an animal has legs, then it jumps
    If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs
    KiKi is an animal
    If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
Logical chain:
    From (1), we know Jane does not like animals that bark.
    From (2), all dogs are animals that bark.
    Therefore, Jane does not like dogs.
    From (4), if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps.
    From (3), Jane likes all animals that jump.
    Therefore, if KiKi has legs, then Jane likes KiKi.
    This contradicts (1), so KiKi cannot have legs.
    From (5), if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs.
    Since KiKi does not have legs, KiKi cannot be terricolous.
    Therefore, KiKi is neither terricolous nor has legs.
    From (7), if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
    Since KiKi does not have legs, KiKi must be terricolous.

    D → ¬A
    A → J
    L → J

Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know KiKi is an animal (A = True).
    From (7), we know KiKi either jumps (J = True) or has legs (L = True).
    If KiKi jumps (J = True), then from (2), KiKi cannot be a dog (D = False).
    If KiKi has legs (L = True), then from (5), KiKi is terricolous (T = True).
    From (6), KiKi is an animal (A = True).
    From (4), if KiKi has legs (L = True), then KiKi jumps (J = True).
    Therefore, KiKi must be a dog (D = True).

Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /beacon-scratch/tongzh24/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members" that everyone in the club must fall into one of these two categories.
Step 3: The premise "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school" tells us that if someone in the club chaperones high school dances, they are not students.
Step 4: The premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances" tells us that if someone in the club is inactive and disinterested, they chaperone high school dances.
Step 5: The premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" tells us that if someone in the club is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic careers and educational opportunities, they are students.
Step 6: The premise "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school" tells us that Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student, or she is not.
Step 7: Combining steps 1 and 6, we know that if Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, she performs in school talent shows often.
Step 8: Combining steps 3, 4, and 5, we can see that if Bonnie is not a student, she is inactive and disinterested and chaperones high school dances.
Step 9: Combining steps 4 and 8, we can see that if Bonnie is not a student, she is inactive and disinterested.
Step 10: Combining steps 9 and 6, we can see that Bonnie is not a student and is not someone who attends and is very engaged with school events.
Step 11: Since Bonnie is not a student and is not someone who attends and is very engaged with school events, she does not perform in school talent shows often.
Step 12: Therefore, Bonnie performs in school talent shows often is false.

0 out of 1 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school" that if someone in the club chaperones high school dances, they are not a student.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances" that if someone in the club is inactive and disinterested, they chaperone high school dances.

Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if someone in the club is inactive and disinterested, they are not a student.

Step 4: We also know from the premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" that if someone in the club is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities, they are a student.

Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can see that there is a clear contradiction: someone in the club can be either inactive and disinterested (and not a student) or a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities (and is a student).

Step 6: This means that the premise "Bonnie is either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school" is false.

0 out of 2 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school," we know Bonnie is in the club and has one of two possibilities:
    - She attends school, is very engaged with school events, and is a student.
    - She does not attend school and is not very engaged with school events.
Step 2:  We also know from the premise "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events" that if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, she attends school and is very engaged with school events.
Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can see that Bonnie must be a student.
Step 4:  We also know from the premise "All people in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school" that if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she is not a student.
Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can see that Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances.
Step 6: Since Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances, we can use the premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances" to deduce that Bonnie is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
Step 7: The premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" tells us that if Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, she is a student.
Step 8: Combining steps 3 and 7, we can see that Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities.
Step 9:  Combining steps 6 and 8, we can see that Bonnie is not both an inactive and disinterested member of the community and a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities.
Step 10: Therefore, the statement "If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community" is false.

Step 5: The premise "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home" tells us that if James is in another country, he is working remotely from home.
Step 6: The premise "No managers work remotely from home" tells us that if James is a manager, he does not work remotely from home.
Step 7: We are given that "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager." This means that if James is a manager, he will appear in the company today, and if he is not a manager, he will not appear in the company today.

Step 1: From the premise "All aliens are extraterrestrials" and "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien," we can conclude that if someone is from Mars, then they are an extraterrestrial.
Step 2: We also know "No extraterrestrials are human."
Step 3: The premise "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans" tells us that if someone is highly intelligent and from Earth, then they are human.
Step 4: The premise "Marvin is a highly intelligent being" tells us Marvin is highly intelligent.
Step 5: The premise "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither" tells us Marvin is from either Earth and Mars or neither.
Step 6: We need to consider two possibilities:
    - If Marvin is from Earth and Mars, then he is both from Earth and an alien (from steps 1, 2, and 3).
    - If Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars, then he is an extraterrestrial (from steps 1 and 5).

Step 1: We know from the premise "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor" that Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "Djokovic is at the mixer" that Djokovic is at the mixer.

Step 3: We need to analyze the remaining premises to determine whether Djokovic is more likely to be a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.

Step 4:  Let's consider the possibilities:

- If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, then he is a professional tennis player (premise 2).
- If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, then he is a celebrity (premise 3).

Step 5:  We also know that all celebrities are well-paid (premise 5).

Step 6:  We also know that all well-paid people live in tax havens (premise 7).

Step 7:  Combining steps 4 and 6, if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, he is well-paid and lives in a tax haven.

Step 8:  We also know that all athletes are famous (premise 6).

Step 9:  Combining steps 4 and 8, if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he is a famous athlete.

Step 10:  Combining steps 7 and 9, if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, he is well-paid and lives in a tax haven, while if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he is famous.

Step 11:  We are given the premise "If a person at the mixer is a famous athlete, then they are well-paid."  This means that if Djokovic is famous, he is well-paid.

Step 12:  Combining steps 10 and 11, we can see that both paths (Djokovic being a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor) lead to him being well-paid.

Step 13:  Therefore, Djokovic is well-paid regardless of whether he is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.

Step 14:  However, the premises do not definitively state that Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. 

Step 15:  Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries" that if something is Zaha Hadid and adored by Max, then it has interesting geometries.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries" that if something is brutalist and adored by Max, then it does not have interesting geometries.

Step 3: Combining these two premises, we see that there is a contradiction. This means that there cannot be something that is both Zaha Hadid and brutalist and adored by Max.

Step 4:  The premise "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style" tells us that if something is adored by Max, it must be one of these two styles.

Step 5: We also know from the premises "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative" and "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy" that if something is Kelly Wearstler and adored by Max, then it is both evocative and dreamy.

Step 6: The premise "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative" tells us that if something is adored by Max and has interesting geometries, then it is both brutalist and evocative.

Step 7: Combining steps 5 and 6, we see that if something is adored by Max and has interesting geometries, then it is both Kelly Wearstler and brutalist.

Step 8: This contradicts our finding in steps 1-3, meaning that something cannot be both Zaha Hadid and brutalist and adored by Max.

Step 9: Therefore, the conclusion "A design by Max is a brutalist building" is **false**.

Step 4: Combining steps 1 and 3, we can deduce that if someone is ranked highly by the WTA and lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis.
Step 5: This contradicts the premise "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022." 
Step 6: Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, we know from step 2 that she is either female or male.
Step 7: Combining steps 4 and 5, we can see that Coco Gauff cannot be both ranked highly by the WTA and lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022.
Step 8: Therefore, Coco Gauff must be male and lost to Rafael Nadal.
Step 9: This contradicts the premise "All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal."
Step 10: This means that Coco Gauff cannot be both ranked highly by the WTA and lost to Rafael Nadal.
Step 11: Therefore, Coco Gauff must be ranked highly by the WTA and did not lose to Rafael Nadal.
Step 12: This means Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.

Step 1: The premise states that "All cats are mammals." This means that if something is a cat, it must also be a mammal.
Step 2: The premise also states that "Some pets are not mammals." This means there exist pets that do not possess the characteristic of being a mammal.
Step 3:  Since we know all cats are mammals and some pets are not mammals, it is possible for pets to be non-mammals while cats remain mammals. 
Step 4: Therefore, the statement "No pets are cats" is false.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "Emma's favorite season is summer" that Emma has summer as her favorite season.

Step 3: The premise "Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's" tells us that Mia's favorite season is different from Emma's.

Step 4: Since Emma's favorite season is summer and Mia's favorite season is different, Mia cannot have summer as her favorite season.

Step 5:  We are left with three other seasons to consider: Spring, Fall, and Winter.

Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if something is a streaming service, it cannot be analog.
Step 4: The premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book" tells us that if 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is also a hardcover book.
Step 5: Since we know from steps 1-3 that streaming services cannot be analog, and the premise states that if 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book, we can conclude that 1984 cannot be analog.
Step 6: We also know from the premise "Every printed text is analog" that if something is printed text, it is analog.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "No digital media are analog" that if something is digital media, it cannot be analog.

Step 3: The premise "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book" tells us that if 1984 is a streaming service, then it also has the property of being a hardcover book.

Step 4: Combining steps 1 and 3, we can conclude that if 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book and therefore is analog (since hardcover books are analog).

Step 5: This creates a contradiction with the premise "No digital media are analog."

 57%|█████▋    | 4/7 [00:23<00:17,  5.82s/it]Step 1: We know from the premise "All legal entities are created under law" that if something is a legal entity, it was created under law. 
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All legal entities have legal obligations" that if something is a legal entity, it has legal obligations.
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if something is a legal entity, it is created under law and has legal obligations.
Step 4: The premise "All business organizations are legal entities" tells us that if something is a business organization, it is a legal entity.
Step 5: The premise "All companies are business organizations" tells us that if something is a company, it is a business organization.
Step 6: The premise "All private companies are companies" tells us that if something is a private company, it is a company.
Step 7: Combining steps 4, 5, and 6, we can conclude that if something is a private company, it is a business organization, which means it is a legal entity.
Step 8: Since we know from steps 1 and 2 that if something is a legal entity, it is created under law and has legal obligations, we can conclude that if something is a private company, it is created under law and has legal obligations.
Step 9: Therefore, the statement "The Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations and is a private company" is true.

67 out of 97 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All companies are business organizations" and "All business organizations are legal entities." Therefore, if something is a company, it is also a legal entity.
Step 2: We also know from the premises that "All legal entities are created under law." 
Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that if something is a company, it is created under law.
Step 4: The premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company" tells us that if something is created under law, it cannot be a private company.
Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can see that if something is a company, it cannot be created under law.
Step 6: This creates a contradiction. 
Step 7: Since we know from steps 1-3 that if something is a company, it is created under law, and step 5 states that if something is a company, it cannot be created under law, the statement "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law" is a false statement.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates."
Step 2: We also know from the premises that "All vertebrate animals have a backbone."
Step 3: We also know from the premises that "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating."
Step 4: We know from the premises that "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating."
Step 5: We also know from the premises that "All queen bees are bees."
Step 6: We know from the premises that "Harry is a bee."
Step 7: Since Harry is a bee and all bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating, Harry cannot be a vertebrate.
Step 8: Since Harry is not a vertebrate and all vertebrates have backbones, Harry cannot be an invertebrate.
Step 9: Since Harry is not a vertebrate or an invertebrate, Harry cannot be classified as either.
Step 10: Since Harry is not a vertebrate or an invertebrate and is still a bee, Harry must be a queen bee.

68 out of 100 is correct!
Step 1:  We know from the premises that "All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates" and "All vertebrate animals have a backbone." Therefore, if Harry is a vertebrate, then Harry is an animal with a backbone.

Step 2:  We also know that "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" and "All queen bees are bees." Therefore, if Harry is a bee, then Harry does not reproduce by male-and-female mating.

Step 3:  The conclusion states that "If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee."  This means that if Harry is a vertebrate and has a backbone, or if Harry is neither a vertebrate nor has a backbone, then Harry is not an invertebrate and not a queen bee.

Step 4:  Combining steps 1 and 2, we can see that if Harry is a vertebrate, then Harry is not a queen bee.

Step 5:  Therefore, the conclusion is true.

Step 1: From the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers," we know Luke is in one of two possibilities:
    - He is born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers.
    - He is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
Step 2:  Let:
    - M: Luke is born in a multiple birth
    - S: Luke lives with strangers
Step 3:  We can represent the two possibilities as:
    - M ∧ S
    - ¬M ∧ ¬S
Step 4:  From the premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings," we know that if Luke is born in a multiple birth (M is True), then he spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.
Step 5:  From the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth," we know that if Luke has siblings born together (which implies he is born in a multiple birth), then he is born in a multiple birth.
Step 6:  From the premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together," we know that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, then he has siblings born together.
Step 7:  From the premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers," we know that if Luke lives at home, then he does not live with strangers.
Step 8:  From the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home," we know that if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings, then he often lives at home.
Step 9:  Combining steps 7 and 8, we can conclude that if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings, then he does not live with strangers.
Step 10:  Combining steps 9 and 2, we can see that the only way Luke can spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings is if he is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
Step 11:  Therefore, Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.

68 out of 102 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers," we know that Luke is either a multiple birth baby living with strangers or not a multiple birth baby living with strangers. 

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If people are born in a multiple birth with siblings, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings." 

Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can deduce that if Luke is a multiple birth baby, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.

Step 4: We also know from the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home." 

Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can deduce that if Luke is a multiple birth baby, then he often lives at home.

Step 6: We also know from the premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers."

Step 7: Combining steps 5 and 6, we can deduce that if Luke is a multiple birth baby, then he does not live with strangers. 

Step 8: This contradicts the first premise, which states that Luke either lives with strangers or is not a multiple birth baby. 

Step 9: Therefore, Luke cannot be a multiple birth baby.

Step 10: Since Luke is not a multiple birth baby, he does not have siblings.

Step 11: We also know from the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth." 

Step 12: Since Luke does not have siblings, he was not born in a multiple birth.

Step 13: We also know from the premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together." 

Step 14: Since Luke does not have siblings, he does not complain often about annoying siblings.

69 out of 103 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings" that if someone is born in a multiple birth, they spend a lot of time with their siblings.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth" that if someone has siblings born together, they were born in a multiple birth.

Step 3:  The premise "If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together" tells us that if someone complains about annoying siblings, they have siblings born together.

Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that if someone complains often about annoying siblings, they are born in a multiple birth.

Step 5: The premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers" states that if someone lives at home, they do not live with strangers.

Step 6: The premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home" tells us that if someone spends a lot of time with their siblings, they often live at home.

Step 7: Combining steps 1 and 6, we can deduce that if someone is born in a multiple birth, they often live at home.

Step 8: Combining steps 4 and 7, we can deduce that if someone complains often about annoying siblings, they often live at home.

Step 9: Combining steps 5 and 8, we can deduce that if someone complains often about annoying siblings, they do not live with strangers.

Step 10: The premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" tells us that Luke is either born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.

Step 11: We have established that if someone is born in a multiple birth, they do not live with strangers (steps 7 and 9). 

Step 12: Therefore, the only way Luke can be born in a multiple birth and live with strangers is if he is not born in a multiple birth.

Step 13: This creates a contradiction. 

Step 14: Therefore, Luke must be neither born in a multiple birth nor complain often about annoying siblings.

Step 1: We know from the premise "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy" that if someone spills a lot of food, they cannot be notably tidy.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing" that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants, they spill a lot of food.

Step 3: The premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy" tells us that if someone is cleanly, they are notably tidy.

Step 4: The premise "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" tells us that if someone values order and spotlessness, they are cleanly.

Step 5: The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if someone's family values order and spotlessness, they themselves value order and spotlessness.

Step 6: The premise "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly" tells us Peter has one of two possibilities: he spills a lot of food and is cleanly, or he doesn't spill a lot of food and isn't cleanly.

Step 7: We need to analyze Peter's possibilities:
    - If Peter spills a lot of food and is cleanly, we know from steps 1 and 3 that he is not notably tidy.
    - If Peter doesn't spill a lot of food and isn't cleanly, we know from steps 4 and 5 that he doesn't value order and spotlessness, and therefore isn't notably tidy.

Step 8: Since both possibilities for Peter result in him not being notably tidy, we can conclude that Peter is not notably tidy.

Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can deduce that if people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not cleanly.
Step 4: The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if someone values order and spotlessness, then their family does too.
Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can deduce that if someone spills a lot of food on their clothing, then their family does not prioritize order and spotlessness.
Step 6:  The premise "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing" tells us that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, then they spill a lot of food on their clothing.

Step 1:  We know from the premises that "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy." This means that if someone spills a lot of food on their clothing, they cannot be notably tidy.

Step 2: We also know "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing." This means that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, they spill a lot of food on their clothing.

Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, they are not notably tidy.

Step 4: We also know "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy." This means that if someone is cleanly, they are notably tidy.

Step 5: We also know "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly." This means that if someone values order and spotlessness, they are cleanly.

Step 6: We also know "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness." This means that if someone's family prioritizes order and spotlessness, they value order and spotlessness.

Step 9: Combining steps 3 and 8, we can conclude that if someone is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, they are not notably tidy.

Step 10: We also know "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly." This means Peter is in one of two states: he is both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or he is neither.

Step 11: Combining steps 9 and 10, we can conclude that Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is cleanly.

Step 12: Combining steps 8 and 11, we can conclude that Peter cannot be both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and has a family who prioritizes order and spotlessness.

Step 13: Therefore, Peter must be neither a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor has a family who prioritizes order and spotlessness.

Step 1: The premise "All fir trees are evergreens" tells us that every fir tree is an evergreen.
Step 2: The premise "Some objects of worship are fir trees" tells us there exists at least one object of worship that is also a fir tree.
Step 3: Since all fir trees are evergreens, this object of worship is also an evergreen.
Step 4:  We don't know if there are other objects of worship besides fir trees.
Step 5:  Therefore, while we know at least one evergreen is an object of worship, it's possible there are other objects of worship that are not fir trees. 
Step 6:  This means it is possible that some evergreens are not objects of worship.

Step 3: The premise "The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated" tells us that the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located within the Picuris Mountains.
Step 4: The premise "There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines that have been donated" states that if a mountain range in Texas has a mine, that mine has not been donated.
Step 5: Since the Picuris Mountains are in either New Mexico or Texas, we need to consider both possibilities.
Step 6: If the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico, then the Harding Pegmatite Mine is in New Mexico.
Step 7: If the Picuris Mountains are in Texas, then the Harding Pegmatite Mine is in Texas.
Step 8: In either case, the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in a mountain range.
Step 9: Since the Harding Pegmatite Mine is in a mountain range, it cannot be in a mountain range that has not been donated.
Step 10: Therefore, the Harding Pegmatite Mine must be in a mountain range that has been donated.
Step 11: The conclusion states that the Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico. This contradicts our finding in steps 6-10.
Step 12: Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: The premise states that "Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin." 
Step 2: The premise also states that "Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island."
Step 3: The premise "Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands" tells us that Snow Island is in the South Shetland Islands.
Step 4: The premise "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands" tells us that Antarctica is in the South Shetland Islands.
Step 5: Therefore, we can conclude that Barutin Cove is in the South Shetland Islands.
Step 6: The premise "If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C" tells us that if something is in a place that is in another place, then it is in the larger place.
Step 7: Since Barutin Cove is in the South Shetland Islands, and the South Shetland Islands are in Antarctica, we can conclude that Barutin Cove is in Antarctica.
Step 8: However, the statement "Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica" is too strong. 
Step 9: The premises only say Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin, not all islands in Antarctica.

Step 1: The premise states that "Some affection is love." This means there exists at least one instance where something is both affection and love. 
Step 2: The premise also states that "Some love is positive." This means there exists at least one instance where something is both love and positive.
Step 3:  Since both premises establish the existence of instances where something is both affection and love, and also instances where something is both love and positive, it is reasonable to conclude that there must be at least one instance where something is both affection and positive.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "Some mammals have teeth" that there exist mammals with teeth.
Step 3: The premise "Platypuses have no teeth" tells us that platypuses are not among the mammals that have teeth.
Step 4: We also know "Humans have teeth", and since humans are mammals, we can conclude that humans are one of the mammals that have teeth.
Step 5: Since platypuses are mammals but lack teeth, and humans are mammals with teeth, we can conclude that platypuses are not the same as humans.
Step 6: While we know platypuses are mammals and not reptiles, we cannot definitively say they are reptiles.  
Step 7: Therefore, the statement "Platypuses are reptiles" is false.

89 out of 138 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning" that the state-of-the-art text summarization model must be trained with one of these three types of algorithms.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model." 
Step 3: Therefore, the state-of-the-art text summarization model must be trained with either supervised learning or unsupervised learning.
Step 4: The premise "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data" tells us that if the model uses supervised learning, it requires labeled data.
Step 5: The premise "Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data" tells us that if the model uses unsupervised learning, it does not require labeled data.
Step 6: Since the state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms and requires labeled data, we can conclude that it is trained with supervised learning.
Step 7: Therefore, the statement "Unsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" is false.

109 out of 174 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits." This means if someone eats salads regularly, they must be health-conscious.

Step 2: We also know that "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly." This means if someone grew up in a health-conscious home, they eat salads regularly.

Step 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that "All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes are very conscious about their health and eating habits."

Step 4: We also know that "All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes." This means if someone fulfills their daily nutritional intakes, they grew up in a health-conscious home.

Step 5: We also know that "All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits."

Step 6: We also know that "If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes." This means if someone visits the gym daily, they fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.

Step 7: Combining steps 4 and 6, we can conclude that "All people who visit the gym at least once a day grew up in health-conscious childhood homes."

Step 8: Combining steps 3 and 7, we can conclude that "All people who visit the gym at least once a day are very conscious about their health and eating habits."

Step 9: Since steps 8 and 5 contradict each other, it means there is no overlap between people who visit the gym daily and people who disregard their physical well-being.

Step 10: We also know from the premises that "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither." This means Taylor must be in one of two states: she is health-conscious and visits the gym daily, or she is neither health-conscious nor visits the gym daily.

Step 11: Since steps 9 and 10 contradict each other, it means Taylor must be neither health-conscious nor visits the gym daily.

Step 2: We also know from the premises "Jane likes all animals that jump" and "If an animal has legs, then it jumps" that if an animal has legs, Jane likes it.

Step 3:  Combining steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that Jane does not like animals that have legs.

Step 4:  The premise "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs" tells us that if an animal is terricolous, it has legs.

Step 5: Combining steps 2 and 4, we can conclude that Jane does not like terricolous animals.

Step 6: The premise "KiKi is an animal" tells us we are dealing with a specific animal.

Step 7:  We don't know if KiKi has legs or is terricolous. 

Step 8: The premise "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs" is redundant. It essentially states that KiKi is either terricolous or has legs, which we already know from steps 3 and 4.

Step 9:  Therefore, KiKi must be either terricolous or has legs.

Step 10:  Since KiKi is either terricolous or has legs, we know from steps 3 and 5 that Jane does not like KiKi.

Step 11:  Since Jane does not like KiKi, and KiKi is an animal, we can conclude that KiKi does not bark.

Step 12:  We also know from step 1 that Jane does not like dogs, and KiKi is an animal. Therefore, KiKi is not a dog.

    T: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events
    S: Bonnie is a student who attends the school
    C: Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community
    D: Bonnie chaperones high school dances
Premises:
    If Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, then she is a student who attends the school. (T → S)
    If Bonnie is in the club, then she is either T ∧ S or ¬(T ∧ S).
    If Bonnie is in the club and she chaperones high school dances, then she is not a student who attends the school. (D → ¬S)
    If Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community, then she chaperones high school dances. (C → D)
    All young children and teenagers in the club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. (This premise does not directly relate to Bonnie)
    Bonnie is in the club and she is either T ∧ S or ¬(T ∧ S).
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know Bonnie is in the club and is either T ∧ S or ¬(T ∧ S).
    Let's consider both possibilities:
        - If Bonnie is T ∧ S, then from (1), she is a student who attends the school.
        - If Bonnie is ¬(T ∧ S), then she is not a student who attends the school.
    From (2), we know Bonnie is either T ∧ S or ¬(T ∧ S).
    From (3), if Bonnie is in the club and she chaperones high school dances, then she is not a student who attends the school.
    From (4), if Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community, then she chaperones high school dances.
    Combining (2), (3), and (4), we can see that if Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community, then she cannot be a student who attends the school.
    Therefore, if Bonnie is in the club and is inactive and disinterested in the community, then she must be a student who attends the school. This is a contradiction.
    Therefore, Bonnie cannot be inactive and disinterested in the community if she is in the club.
    Since Bonnie is in the club and is either T ∧ S or ¬(T ∧ S), she must be T ∧ S.
    From (1), if Bonnie is T ∧ S, then she is a student who attends the school.
    Therefore, Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.

0 out of 1 is correct!
Let:
    Y: Bonnie is a young child
    T: Bonnie is a teenager
    A: Bonnie attends school
    C: Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community
Premises:
    If Bonnie is in the club and performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events.
    If Bonnie is in the club, then Bonnie performs in school talent shows often or is an inactive and disinterested community member.
    If Bonnie is in the club and chaperones high school dances, then Bonnie is not a student who attends the school.
    If Bonnie is in the club and is an inactive and disinterested member of the community, then Bonnie chaperones high school dances.
    If Bonnie is in the club and is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie attends the school.
    Bonnie is in the club and is either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

Logical Chain:

From (5), we know that if Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie attends the school. 
From (3), if Bonnie is in the club and chaperones high school dances, then Bonnie is not a student who attends the school.
Combining these two premises, we can see that Bonnie cannot be both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances. 
Therefore, the condition "Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances" is false.
Since the condition is false, the conclusion is true.

Let:
    C: James has lunch in the company
    H: James has lunch at home
    M: James is a manager
    O: James is in other countries
    E: James is an employee
Premises:
    If James schedules a meeting with their customers, he will go to the company building today. (C → E)
    Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. (E → C)
    Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home. (C ∨ H)

    No managers work remotely from home. (M → ¬R)
    James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager. (M ↔ C)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know that if James is a manager, he does not work remotely from home.
    From (5), if James is in other countries, he works remotely from home.
    Therefore, if James is a manager and in other countries, he cannot work remotely from home. This is a contradiction.
    From (7), we know that James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

1 out of 4 is correct!
Let:
    C: James has lunch in the company
    H: James has lunch at home
    M: James is a manager
Premises:
    If James schedules a meeting with their customers, he will go to the company building today.
    Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
    Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
    If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
    All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
    No managers work remotely from home.
    James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    James does not have lunch in the company, which translates to ¬C.
Logical Chain:

From (6), if James is a manager, he does not work remotely from home.
From (5), if James is in other countries, he works remotely from home.
From (7), James appears in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
Therefore, if James appears in the company today, he is not in other countries.
From (3), James has lunch either in the company building or at home.
From (2), if James has lunch in the company building, he schedules meetings with his customers.
From (1), if James schedules meetings with his customers, he goes to the company building today.
Therefore, if James has lunch in the company building, he appears in the company today.
Combining (4) and (7), if James appears in the company today, he is not a manager.
This creates a contradiction.
Therefore, James must not have lunch in the company building.

    James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.
Logical Chain:
    From (6) and (5), we know that if James is in other countries, he works remotely from home.
    From (4), if James has lunch at home, he works remotely from home.
    Therefore, if James is in other countries, he has lunch at home.
    From (2), if James has lunch at home, he schedules meetings with customers.
    From (1), if James schedules meetings with customers, he goes to the company building.
    Therefore, if James is in other countries, he goes to the company building.

    M: Monkeypox virus occurs in a being
    A: Being is an animal
    H: Being is a human
    F: Being has fever
    H2: Being has headache
    M2: Being has muscle pains
    T: Being has tiredness
Premises:
    If the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox. (M → M2)
    Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals. (M → A)
    Humans are mammals. (H → A)
    Mammals are animals. (A → A)
    Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. (M2 ∨ H2 ∨ M2 ∨ T)
    People feel tired when they get the flu. (T → F)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing.
Logical Chain:
    The premises do not mention anything about coughing as a symptom of Monkeypox.

    G: Tom is a Gould's wild turkey
    M: Tom is a Merriam's wild turkey
    R: Tom is a Rio Grande wild turkey
    T: Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey
Premises:
    There are six types of wild turkeys: Eastern wild turkey, Osceola wild turkey, Gould’s wild turkey, Merriam’s wild turkey, Rio Grande wild turkey, and Ocellated wild turkey.
    Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey. (¬E)
    Tom is not an Osceola wild turkey. (¬O)
    Tom is not a Gould's wild turkey. (¬G)
    Tom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey. (¬(M ∨ R))
    Tom is a wild turkey. (T)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey. (T)

Logical chain:

From (2), (3), (4), and (5), we know Tom is not any of the first four types of wild turkeys. 
Since Tom is a wild turkey (5), and the only remaining type is the Ocellated wild turkey (6), Tom must be an Ocellated wild turkey.

Premises:
    There are six types of wild turkeys: Eastern wild turkey, Osceola wild turkey, Gould’s wild turkey, Merriam’s wild turkey, Rio Grande wild turkey, and Ocellated wild turkey.
    Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey.
    Tom is not an Osceola wild turkey.
    Tom is not a Gould's wild turkey.
    Tom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey.

Let:
    T: The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list
    J: The Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese game company
    M: The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies
Premises:
    A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda (J is True)
    All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies (J → T)
    If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list (M → T)
    The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies (M is True)
Logical Chain:
    From (1), J = True
    From (2), if J is True, then T must be True
    From (3), if M is True, then T must be True
    From (4), M is True
    Therefore, T must be True

    M: The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies
Premises:
    T is True (given)
    If a game is on the Top 10 list, then it is made by a Japanese game company. (T → J)
    If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be on the Top 10 list. (M → T10)
    The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies. (M is True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company. (This is uncertain)

Logical chain:
    From (2) and (3), we know that if a game is on the Top 10 list, then it is made by a Japanese game company.
    From (4), we know that The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies, so it is on the Top 10 list.
    Therefore, The Legend of Zelda is made by a Japanese game company.
    However, the premises do not provide any information about whether or not FIFA 22 is on the Top 10 list, so we cannot conclude that FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese game company.

Truth Table (key possibilities):
| T (The Legend of Zelda is made by a Japanese game company) | T10 (The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list) | M (The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies) | FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese game company |

    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. (¬¬T)
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (R ∨ T)
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (S → ¬C)
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (S → S)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (R ∨ T and C)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Rockie is a turtle (T)

Logical Chain:

From (6), we know R ∨ T is True. 
From (5), if Rockie is a rabbit, then R is True. 
From (4), if Rockie is calm, then R must be False.
Since R ∨ T is True and R is False, T must be True.

    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (R ∨ S)
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (¬C → ¬S)
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (S → ¬C)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (R ∨ S) ∧ C
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know R ∨ S is True.
    From (5) and (6), we know C is True.
    From (2), we know T is True.
    From (1), if R were True, then C would be True, which we know is already true.
    From (4) and (5), if S were True, then C would be False, which contradicts our knowledge that C is True.
    Therefore, S must be False.
    From (2), we know T is True.
    From (3), we know R ∨ S is True, and since S is False, R must be True.
    From (1), if R is True, then C is True, which we know is already true.
    Therefore, Rockie is a rabbit.

    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. (∃x (T(x)))
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (R ∨ S)

    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (S → S)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (R ∨ S) ∧ K
Logical Chain:
    From (5) and (6), we know R ∨ S is True.
    From (6), we know K is True.
    From (2), we know T is True.
    From (1), if R is True, then C is True.
    From (3), we know R ∨ S is True.
    From (4), if S is True, then S is True.
    Since R ∨ S is True, either R is True or S is True.
    If R is True, then C is True.

Let:
    R: Rockie is a rabbit
    S: Rockie is a squirrel
    C: Rockie is cute
    Sk: Rockie is skittish
Premises:
    If something is spotted near the campus, then it is either a rabbit or a squirrel.
    All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
Logical Chain:
    From (4), if Rockie is calm, then Rockie cannot be skittish.
    From (2), if Rockie is a rabbit, then Rockie is cute.
    From (3), if Rockie is a squirrel, then Rockie is skittish.
    Therefore, if Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie must be either a rabbit (and thus cute) or a squirrel (and thus skittish).

    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (K → ¬C)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus. (R ∨ S)
    Rockie is calm. (K is True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle. This translates to (C ∧ K) → T.
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know R ∨ S is True.
    From (6), we know K is True.
    From (2), if R is True, then C is True.

Let:
    S: Karen shares "Stranger Things" with Lisa
    B: Karen binge-watches "Black Mirror"
    D: Karen downloads "Black Mirror"
Premises:
    "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
    If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.
    If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.
    Karen does not download "Black Mirror."
    "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
    If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.
Logical chain:
    From (2), if "Stranger Things" is popular, then Karen will binge-watch it.
    From (3), if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, then she will download it.
    From (4), Karen does not download "Black Mirror."
    From (5), "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
    From (6), if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.
    Since Karen does not download "Black Mirror," we can conclude that Karen does not binge-watch it.
    Therefore, Karen will not share "Black Mirror" with Lisa.

Let:
    A: Marvin is an alien
    E: Marvin is from Earth
    M: Marvin is from Mars
Premises:
    All aliens are extraterrestrials. (A → E)
    If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien. (M → A)
    No extraterrestrials are human. (¬A → ¬E)
    All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans. (E → H)
    Marvin is a highly intelligent being. (H is True)
    Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither. (E ∧ M) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬M)
    If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial. (¬E → A)
Logical Chain:

From (5), H = True.
From (4), if H is True, then E must be True.
From (6), Marvin is either from Earth and Mars (E ∧ M) or from neither.
From (3), if E is True, then A must be False.
From (2), if M is True, then A must be True.
Therefore, we have two possibilities:
    - If E ∧ M is True, then A is True.
    - If ¬E ∧ ¬M is True, then A is True.

Truth Table:

| A (Marvin is an alien) | E (Marvin is from Earth) | M (Marvin is from Mars) |

Let:

    E: Marvin is from Earth

Premises:
    All aliens are extraterrestrials (A → E)
    If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien (M → A)
    No extraterrestrials are human (¬A → ¬E)
    All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans (E → H)
    Marvin is a highly intelligent being. (H is True)
    Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither. (E ∨ ¬(E ∧ M))
    If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial. (¬E → A)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars (¬(E ∨ M))
Logical Chain:
    From (4), H is True.
    From (3), if A were True, then E would be False, which contradicts (4). Therefore, A must be False.
    From (2), if M were True, then A would be True, which we know is False. Therefore, M must be False.
    From (6), since E ∨ M is False, Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars.

    All aliens are extraterrestrials. (A → E)
    If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien. (M → A)
    No extraterrestrials are human. (¬A → ¬E)
    All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans. (E → H)
    Marvin is a highly intelligent being. (H)
    Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither. (E ∧ M) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬M)
    If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial. (¬E → A)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human. This translates to ¬M → H.
Logical Chain:

From (5), we know Marvin is a highly intelligent being (H is True).
From (4), if Marvin is from Earth, then Marvin is a human (E → H).
From (6), we know Marvin is either from Earth and Mars (E ∧ M) or from neither (¬E ∧ ¬M).

Let's consider both possibilities:
    - If Marvin is from Earth and Mars (E ∧ M), then Marvin is a human (H) from (4).
    - If Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars (¬E ∧ ¬M), then Marvin is an extraterrestrial (A) from (7).

In both cases, the conclusion ¬M → H is true.

    A: Djokovic is an athlete
    F: Djokovic is famous
    T: Djokovic lives in a tax haven
Premises:
    Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. (G ∨ O)
    Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player. (G → P)
    All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities. (O → C)
    All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes. (P → A)
    If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well-paid. (C → W)

    All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens. (W → T)
    Djokovic is at the mixer: (G ∨ O)
    If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid. (F → W)
Logical Chain:
    From (7), Djokovic is at the mixer.
    We need to determine if T is True.
    Let's analyze the premises and see if we can derive T.
    
    * **Case 1: G is True**
        * From (2), if G is True, then Djokovic is a professional tennis player (P is True).
        * From (4), if P is True, then Djokovic is an athlete (A is True).
        * From (6), if A is True, then Djokovic is famous (F is True).
        * From (5), if F is True, then Djokovic is well-paid (W is True).
        * From (7), if W is True, then Djokovic lives in a tax haven (T is True).
        * Therefore, if G is True, then T is True.

    * **Case 2: O is True**
        * From (3), if O is True, then Djokovic is a celebrity (C is True).
        * From (5), if C is True, then Djokovic is well-paid (W is True).
        * From (7), if W is True, then Djokovic lives in a tax haven (T is True).
        * Therefore, if O is True, then T is True.

    P: Djokovic is a professional tennis player
    C: Djokovic is a celebrity
    F: Djokovic is famous
    T: Djokovic is an athlete
    H: Djokovic lives in a tax haven
Premises:
    Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. (G ∨ O)
    Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player. (G → P)
    All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities. (O → C)
    All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes. (P → T)
    If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well-paid. (C → W)
    If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous. (T → F)
    All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens. (W → H)
    Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid. (F → W)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Djokovic does not live in a tax haven (¬H)
Logical Chain:
    From (7), if Djokovic is well-paid (W is True), then Djokovic lives in a tax haven (H is True).
    From (6), if Djokovic is famous (F is True), then Djokovic is well-paid (W is True).
    From (5), if Djokovic is a celebrity (C is True), then Djokovic is well-paid (W is True).
    From (3), if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor (O is True), then Djokovic is a celebrity (C is True).
    From (2), if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion (G is True), then Djokovic is a professional tennis player (P is True).
    From (4), if Djokovic is a professional tennis player (P is True), then Djokovic is an athlete (T is True).

Let:
    Z: Zaha Hadid's design style
    K: Kelly Wearstler's design style
    B: Brutalist building
Premises:
    If Max adores a design, then it has interesting geometries.
    If Max adores a design, then it is either Z or K.
    If Max adores a design and it has interesting geometries, then it is B and evocative.
    All of Z that Max adores are interesting.
    All of K that Max adores are evocative and dreamy.
Logical Chain:
    We know from (2) that if Max adores a design, it is either Z or K.
    We also know from (3) that if Max adores a design and it has interesting geometries, then it is B and evocative.
    Combining these two premises, we can see that if Max adores a design and it is Z, then it is B and evocative.
    However, we don't know if Max adores a design or not, so we cannot definitively say that a design by Max is a brutalist building.

    K: Design is Kelly Wearstler's style
    I: Design has interesting geometries
    B: Design is brutalist
    E: Design is evocative
    D: Design is dreamy
Premises:
    If Max adores a design, then it has interesting geometries. (Z ∨ K → I)
    No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries. (B ∧ I → ¬I)
    All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative and dreamy. (K → (E ∧ D))
    If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative. (I → (B ∧ E))
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    A design by Max is evocative and dreamy. (E ∧ D)

Logical Chain:
    From (2), we know that if a design by Max has interesting geometries, then it is not brutalist.
    From (3), if a design by Max is Kelly Wearstler's style, then it is both evocative and dreamy.
    From (4), if a design by Max has interesting geometries, then it is both brutalist and evocative.
    Combining (2) and (4), we see that if a design by Max has interesting geometries, it cannot be both brutalist and evocative.
    Therefore, if a design by Max has interesting geometries, it must be Kelly Wearstler's style.
    From (3), if a design by Max is Kelly Wearstler's style, then it is both evocative and dreamy.
    Therefore, if a design by Max has interesting geometries, it is both evocative and dreamy.

Premises:
    If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. (W → A)
    Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association. (L → W)

    Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022. (G)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.
Logical Chain:
    From (7), G is True.
    From (2), if L is True, then W is True.
    From (3), if F is True, then L is True.
    From (5), if M is True, then N is True.
    From (6), if W ∨ N is True, then ¬M is True.
    We need to analyze the possibilities:
        - If G is True, then from (2) and (3), we can see that Coco Gauff either lost to Iga Świątek (L = True) or is ranked highly (W = True).
        - If L is True, then from (1), Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.
        - If W is True, then from (1), Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.
        - In both cases, if Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis, then from (6), Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.

Premises:
    All cats are mammals. (C → M)
    Some pets are not mammals. (¬M)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    No pets are cats. (¬(C ∧ P))

Logical chain:
    From (2), we know there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal.
    From (1), all cats are mammals.
    Therefore, there must be some pets that are not cats.
Truth Table (for C and P):

    There are four seasons in a year: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter.
    All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
    Emma's favorite season is summer.
    Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
    James wants to have a long vacation.
Logical chain:
    From (2) and (5), we know James wants a long vacation.
    From (2), if James wants a long vacation, then James's favorite season is summer.
    From (3), Emma's favorite season is summer.
    From (4), Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's, so Mia's favorite season is not summer.

    All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
    Emma's favorite season is summer (S = True)
    Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's (¬(M ∨ F ∨ W))
    James wants to have a long vacation.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Mia's favorite season is spring (F = True)

Logical Chain:
    From (3), S = True
    From (4), Mia's favorite season cannot be the same as Emma's, so M ∨ F ∨ W must be False.
    Since M ∨ F ∨ W is False, and S is True, the only remaining option is F must be True.

Premises:
    ¬(D ∧ P) (No digital media are analog)
    P → S (Every printed text is analog)
    D → ¬S (All streaming services are digital)
    H → P (If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed)
    (S → H) (If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book)
Logical Chain:
    We can analyze this problem step by step. 
    From (4) and (5), we know that if 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is printed.
    From (2), if 1984 is printed, then it is analog.
    From (1), we know that if 1984 is digital, then it is not analog.
    From (3), if 1984 is a streaming service, then it is digital.
    Therefore, we can conclude that 1984 cannot be both a hardcover book and a streaming service.

Logical Chain:
    From (4) and (3), we know that if 1984 is printed text, then it is not a streaming service.
    From (2), if 1984 is printed text, then it is a streaming service.
    These two statements create a contradiction.

Premises:
    ¬(D ∧ P)
    P → S
    S → D
    D → P
    S → H (where H is hardcover book)
Logical Chain:
    From (4), if 1984 is a hardcover book (H), then it is printed text (P).
    From (3), if 1984 is a streaming service (S), then it is digital media (D).
    From (2), if 1984 is printed text (P), then it is a streaming service (S).
    Combining (3) and (2), we can conclude that if 1984 is a streaming service (S), then it is a hardcover book (H).
    This creates a contradiction with (4). Therefore, 1984 cannot be a streaming service.

Let:
    R: French is a Romance language
    I: French is an Indo-European language
    G: German is a Romance language
    S: Spanish is a Romance language
    B: Basque is a Romance language
Premises:
    All Romance languages are Indo-European languages (R → I)
    Romance languages are a language family.
    All languages within a language family are related to each other.
    French and Spanish are both Romance languages (R ∨ S)
    German is related to Spanish.
    Basque is not related to any other language.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    French is an Indo-European language (I)

Logical Chain:
    From (4), we know that either R is True or S is True.
    From (2), if R is True, then I is True.
    From (5), if S is True, then German is related to Spanish.
    From (3), if German is related to Spanish, then German is also a Romance language (G = True).
    From (2), if G is True, then German is an Indo-European language.
    Therefore, if R is True, then I is True.
    If S is True, then G is True, and therefore I is True.
Truth Table:
| R (French is a Romance language) | I (French is an Indo-European language) | G (German is a Romance language) | S (Spanish is a Romance language) |

Let:
    S: Robert Lewandowski is a striker
    P: Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player
    B: Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen
Premises:
    S is True (given)
    S → P (Strikers are soccer players)
    B is True (given)
    B → ¬P (If a player leaves a team they no longer play for that team)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    P (Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player)
Logical Chain:
    From (1) S = True
    From (2), if S is True, then P must also be True.
    From (3) B is True.
    From (4), if B is True, then P must be False.

Let:
    B: Butte is in Montana
    H: Helena is in Montana
    M: Missoula is in Montana
    W: White Sulphur Springs is in Montana
    S: St Pierre is in Montana
Premises:
    Billings is in Montana (B = True)
    Montana includes Butte, Helena, and Missoula (B ∨ H ∨ M = True)
    White Sulphur Springs and Butte are in the same state in U.S. (B ∨ W = True)
    The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana (S = False)
    Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre (B ∧ S → False)
    A city can only be in one state in U.S. except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, and Union City. (This premise is irrelevant to the conclusion)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Butte and St Pierre are in the same state (B ∧ S)

Logical Chain:
    From (1), B = True
    From (2), at least one of B, H, or M must be True. Since B is True, we don't need to consider H or M.
    From (3), at least one of B or W is True. We know B is True.
    From (4), S is False.
    From (5), if B were True and S were True, then the statement B ∧ S would be True. However, S is False, so B ∧ S is False.

    The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula. (H = True, M = True)
    White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S. (W = True)
    The city of St. Pierre is not in the state of Montana. (S = False)
    Any city in Butte is not in St. Pierre. (This premise is redundant and can be ignored)
    A city can only be in one state in U.S. except for Bristol, Texarkana, and Union City. (This premise is redundant and can be ignored)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    St. Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state. (S ∧ D)
Logical Chain:

    From (2), H = True and M = True.
    From (3), W = True.

Premises:
    Billings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S. (B = True)
    The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula. (H ∨ M ∨ C = True)
    White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.
    The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana. (S = False)
    Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre. (¬(C ∧ S))
    A city can only be in one state in U.S. except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, and Union City.

    From (1), B = True
    From (2), we know H ∨ M ∨ C = True.

    CPT: Mike applies for CPT
    OPT: Mike applies for OPT
Premises:
    All international students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa (F ∨ J)
    An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT (F → (CPT ∨ OPT))
    Mike is an international student.
    Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US (CPT → Mike wants to work in the US)
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if Mike has an F1 visa, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT.
    From (4), Mike applies for CPT.
    From (2), if Mike has an F1 visa, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT.
    Since Mike applies for CPT, he must have an F1 visa.

    All international students in the US have an F1 or J1 visa. (F ∨ J)
    If an international student in the US has an F1 visa, they need to apply for CPT or OPT. (F → (CPT ∨ OPT))
    Mike is an international student. (Mike is F ∨ J)
    Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US. (CPT)
Logical Chain:
    From (3) and (4), we know Mike is an international student and needs to apply for CPT.
    From (2), if Mike has an F1 visa, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT.

    B: Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle
    P: Ted is a pet
    C: Ted is a cow
    A: Ted is an alligator
Premises:
    All Brown Swiss cattle are cows (B → C)
    Some pets are Brown Swiss Cattle (∃x (P ∧ B))
    All cows are domesticated animals (C → D)
    Alligators are not domesticated animals (¬A → ¬D)
    Ted is an alligator (A is True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet (B → ¬P)

Logical chain:

From (5), we know A is True.
From (4), if A is True, then D is False.
From (2), there exists at least one pet that is a Brown Swiss cattle.
From (1), if Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is a cow.
From (3), if Ted is a cow, then Ted is domesticated.
Therefore, if Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is domesticated.
This contradicts the fact that Ted is an alligator and alligators are not domesticated.
Therefore, if Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted cannot be a pet.

Truth Table:
| B (Brown Swiss cattle) | P (Pet) | C (Cow) | A (Alligator) | D (Domesticated) |

Let:
    G: KO is a growth stock
    R: KO is a retirement fund
    M: KO is a mature stock
    S: KO is a stock
Premises:
    If KO is a growth stock, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. (G → ¬R)
    All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. (M → R)
    Some stocks are growth stocks. (∃x(G(x)))
    All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. (G → P)
    KO is a mature stock. (M(KO))
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    KO is a stock (S(KO))
Logical chain:
    From (5), M(KO) is True.
    From (4), if KO is a mature stock, then KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
    From (2), if KO is suitable for a retirement fund, then KO is not a growth stock.
    From (1), if KO is a growth stock, then KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
    From (3), there exists at least one growth stock.
    Since KO is not a growth stock (from 4 and 2), KO cannot be bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
    Therefore, KO cannot be a growth stock.
    From (3), there exists at least one growth stock, and KO is not one of them.
    From (5), KO is a mature stock.
    From (2), if KO is a mature stock, then KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
    Therefore, KO is a stock.

    M: KO is a mature stock
Premises:
    All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. (G → P)
    If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. (P → ¬R)
    Some stocks are growth stocks. (¬¬G)
    All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. (M → R)
    KO is a mature stock. (M is True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    KO is a stock and a growth stock (G ∧ M)

Logical Chain:
    From (5), M = True.
    From (4), if M is True, then R is True.
    From (2), if P is True, then ¬R is True.
    From (5) and (4), we know KO is a mature stock and suitable for a retirement fund.
    From (2), if KO is a growth stock, then KO cannot be suitable for a retirement fund.
    Therefore, if KO is a growth stock, then KO cannot be a mature stock.

Let:
    G: KO is a growth stock
    R: KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation
    M: KO is a mature stock
    V: KO is volatile
Premises:
    All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. (G → R)
    If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. (R → ¬M)
    Some stocks are growth stocks. (¬¬G)
    All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. (M → S)
    KO is a mature stock. (M is True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile. (G ∨ R → ¬(G ∨ V))
Logical Chain:
    From (5), M is True.
    From (4), if M is True, then KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
    From (3), there exists at least one growth stock.
    From (2), if KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is not suitable for a retirement fund.
    From (1), if KO is a growth stock, then KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
    Therefore, if KO is a growth stock, then KO is not suitable for a retirement fund.
    Since KO is a mature stock (M is True) and KO is not suitable for a retirement fund, KO cannot be a growth stock.
    Therefore, KO is neither a growth stock nor is its price volatile.

    Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. (I is True)
    Tom's license plate begins with the number 35. (¬J)
    If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34. (¬J → ¬T)

    From (2), we know that if Joe's license plate is not from Istanbul (¬I), then it does not begin with 34 (¬J).
    From (3), we know Joe's license plate is from Istanbul (I is True).
    Therefore, Joe's license plate must begin with 34 (J must be True).

    Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. (T ∧ ¬E → (¬P ∧ ¬E))
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know H is True.
    We need to determine if E is True.
    Let's analyze the premises:
    From (5), if D is True, then P is False and C is True.
    From (3), T_freq ∨ D must be True.
    We can analyze the possibilities:
    - If T_freq is True, then T is True (from 2).
    - If D is True, then P is False and C is True.
    - In both cases, if T is True, then E is True (from 1).
    - Therefore, regardless of whether T_freq is True or D is True, E must be True.

51 out of 77 is correct!
Let:
    E: Hannah is a picky eater
    T: Hannah works in student jobs on campus
    D: Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes
    C: Hannah is at Mary's school
    N: Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition
Premises:
    If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition. (T → N)
    If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus. (¬D → T)
    People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes. (¬D ∨ D)
    If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters. (D → ¬E)
    If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. (D → C)
    Hannah is at Mary's school. (C is True)
    Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. (T ∧ ¬(N ∨ E))
Logical Chain:

From (6), C = True.
From (2), if Hannah is at Mary's school (C is True), then she either works in student jobs on campus (T is True) or orders takeout frequently (¬D is True).
From (7), if Hannah works in student jobs on campus (T is True), then she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition (N is True).
From (1), if Hannah works in student jobs on campus (T is True), then she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition (N is True).
From (5), if Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes (D is True), then she is not a picky eater (¬E is True).
From (7), if Hannah works in student jobs on campus (T is True), then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition (¬E ∧ ¬N).
Combining (4) and (7), we can see that if Hannah is not a picky eater (¬E is True), then she is not at Mary's school (C is False). This creates a contradiction.

Let:
    B: Baked by Melissa
    C: Cupcakes
    M: Mala hotpots
    D: Dried Thai chilies
Premises:
    ¬(B ∧ M)
    C → B
    M → ¬S
    D → (M ∨ C ∨ ¬B)
Logical Chain:
    From (2) and (3), we know that if something is a cupcake, it is not spicy.
    From (4), if something is dried Thai chilies, it is either a mala hotpot, a cupcake, or not baked by Melissa.
    Combining these two premises, we can see that dried Thai chilies cannot be cupcakes.
    Therefore, the only remaining possibility for dried Thai chilies is that they are not baked by Melissa.

    D: Dried Thai Chilies
Premises:
    ¬(B ∧ S) (No baked sweets are spicy)
    C → B (All cupcakes are baked sweets)
    S → M (All mala hotpots are spicy)
    B → C (All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes)
    D → (S ∨ M ∨ ¬S) (Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    ¬(D ∧ B) (Dried Thai chilies are not products of Baked by Melissa)
Logical Chain:

From (3) and (4), we know that if something is a cupcake, it is spicy. 
From (2), if something is a product of Baked by Melissa, it is a cupcake.
Therefore, if something is a product of Baked by Melissa, it is spicy.
From (1), no baked sweets are spicy.
Therefore, a product of Baked by Melissa cannot be spicy.
From (5), if something is spicy, it is not a baked sweet.
Therefore, a product of Baked by Melissa cannot be a baked sweet.
This contradicts (2), so the conclusion is false.

Let:
    R: Restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations
    N: Restaurant has not received many negative reviews
    T: Restaurant provides take-out service
    L: Restaurant is popular among local residents
    H: Restaurant is the Hamden Plaza Subway store
Premises:
    If a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews. (R → N)
    All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp's recommendations. (G > 4 → R)
    Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. (¬T → N)
    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four. (L → G)
    The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. (G ∨ L)
Logical Chain:
    We need to analyze the statement "If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service."
    This translates to (T ∧ N) → (G ∧ ¬T)
    Let's break down this statement:
        - (T ∧ N): The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service AND has not received many negative reviews.
        - (G ∧ ¬T): The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than 4 AND does not provide take-out service.

    We need to determine if this statement is true, false, or uncertain.

Premises:
    If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews. (R → ¬N)
    All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations. (R → G)
    Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. (¬T → N)
    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four. (P → G)

    G: Sir Digby is a good guy
    B: Sir Digby's nemesis is a bad guy
    F: Sir Digby fights his nemesis
    W: Sir Digby wins
    N: Sir Digby's nemesis wins
Premises:
    In superhero movies, the good guys always win (G → W)
    The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is a superhero movie.
    Good guys fight bad guys and vice versa (G → ¬B)
    Sir Digby fights his nemesis.
    If a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is a good guy (G → N)
    The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is named after Sir Digby.
    If somebody wins a fight, the person they are fighting does not win (W → ¬N)
    If a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is in the movie.
Logical chain:
    From (5) and (6), G = True
    From (2) and (5), Sir Digby is a good guy.
    From (3), if Sir Digby is a good guy, then his nemesis is a bad guy (B = False).
    From (4), Sir Digby fights his nemesis.
    From (7), if Sir Digby wins, then his nemesis does not win (N = False).
    From (1), if Sir Digby is a good guy, then he wins (W = True).
    Therefore, Sir Digby's nemesis does not win (N = False).

    P: Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company
    L: Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law
Premises:
    All business organizations are legal entities. (B → L)
    All companies are business organizations. (C → B)
    All private companies are companies. (P → C)
    All legal entities are created under law. (L → C)
    All legal entities have legal obligations. (L → O)
    If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. (L → ¬P)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations and is a private company (O ∧ P)
Logical Chain:

We can analyze this using truth tables or reasoning step by step. Let's use reasoning:

1. We know from (4) that if Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law (L is True), then it is a legal entity.
2. We also know from (5) that if Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity (L is True), then it has legal obligations (O is True).
3. However, we also know from (6) that if Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law (L is True), then it is not a private company (P is False).
4. Therefore, if Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law (L is True), then it has legal obligations (O is True) but is not a private company (P is False).

Truth Table:
| B (Business Organization) | C (Company) | P (Private Company) | L (Created under Law) | O (Legal Obligations) |

Let:
    V: Harry is a vertebrate
    I: Harry is an invertebrate
    M: Harry is a male
    F: Harry is a female
    Q: Harry is a queen
Premises:
    All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. (V ∨ I)
    All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. (V → M ∧ F)
    All vertebrate animals have a backbone. (V → V)
    All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. (¬(M ∧ F))
    All queen bees are bees. (Q → B)
    Harry is a bee. (B)
Logical chain:
    From (5), B is True.
    From (4), if Harry is a bee, then Harry cannot reproduce by male-and-female mating.
    From (2), if Harry is a vertebrate, then Harry must reproduce by male-and-female mating.
    Since Harry is a bee (B is True) and does not reproduce by male-and-female mating, Harry cannot be a vertebrate.
    From (3), if Harry is a vertebrate, then Harry has a backbone. Since Harry is not a vertebrate, Harry does not have a backbone.
    From (1), Harry must be an invertebrate.
    From (5), if Harry is a queen, then Harry is a bee. Since Harry is a bee, Harry could be a queen.

    All queen bees are bees. (Q → B)
    Harry is a bee. (B)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee. (V ∨ Q)

Logical Chain:

From (6), we know B = True.
From (5), if Harry is a queen bee, then Harry is a bee.
From (2), if Harry is a vertebrate, then Harry is a male-and-female mating animal.
From (4), if Harry is a bee, then Harry is not a male-and-female mating animal.
Therefore, if Harry is a vertebrate, then Harry cannot be a bee.
This means Harry must be an invertebrate.

Let:
    V: Harry is a vertebrate
    B: Harry is an animal with a backbone
    I: Harry is an invertebrate
    Q: Harry is a queen bee
Premises:
    All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. (V ∨ I)
    All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. (B → M)
    All vertebrate animals have a backbone. (V → B)
    All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. (B → ¬M)
    All queen bees are bees. (Q → B)
    Harry is a bee. (Q is True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.
Logical Chain:
    From (6), Q = True.
    From (5), if Q is True, then B is True.
    From (3), if B is True, then V is True.
    Therefore, if Harry is a queen bee, then Harry is a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone.
    The conclusion states that if Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.
    Since Harry is already a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone (from the above reasoning), this conclusion is redundant.

    S: Luke has siblings
    H: Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings
    L: Luke lives at home
    St: Luke lives with strangers

Premises:
    If people who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings. (M ∧ S → H)
    If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth. (S → M)
    If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together. (¬H → ¬M)
    If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers. (L → ¬St)
    If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. (H → L)
    Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. (M ∧ St) ∨ (¬M ∧ ¬St)
Logical chain:

From (6), we know that Luke is either born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. 

Let's consider both possibilities:

* **Case 1: Luke is born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers (M ∧ St)**
    * From (2), if Luke is born in a multiple birth, then he has siblings. (S = True)
    * From (1), if Luke is born in a multiple birth and has siblings, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with them. (H = True)
* **Case 2: Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers (¬M ∧ ¬St)**
    * From (3), if Luke does not have siblings who were born together, then he does not complain about annoying siblings.
    * From (4), if Luke does not live with strangers, then he lives at home. (L = True)
    * From (5), if Luke lives at home, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings. (H = True)

Truth Table (for Luke):

Let:

Premises:
    If people who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
    If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
    If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
    If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
    If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home.
    Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Luke complains often about annoying siblings.

Logical Chain:
    From (5), if Luke lives at home, then he does not live with strangers.
    From (6), Luke either lives at home with strangers or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
    Combining (5) and (6), we can conclude that Luke does not live at home.
    From (4), if Luke does not live at home, then he does not live with strangers.
    From (3), if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, then he has siblings who were born together.
    From (2), if Luke has siblings who were born together, then he was born in a multiple birth.
    From (1), if Luke was born in a multiple birth, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.
    From (5), if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, then he often lives at home.
    From (4), we know Luke does not live at home.
    Therefore, Luke cannot be born in a multiple birth and spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.
    Since Luke does not live at home and does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, he does not have siblings who were born together.
    From (3), if Luke does not have siblings who were born together, then he does not complain often about annoying siblings.

Premises:

    If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth. (S → M)
    If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together. (C → S)
    If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers. (H → ¬¬S)
    If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. (M ∧ S → H)
    Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. (M ∧ ¬S) ∨ (¬M ∧ ¬S)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings. This translates to ¬M ∧ ¬C
Logical Chain:

From (6), we know Luke is either born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers (M ∧ ¬S) or not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers (¬M ∧ ¬S). 

Let's consider both possibilities:
* **Case 1: M ∧ ¬S**
    From (2), if Luke is born in a multiple birth, then he has siblings (S = True). 
    From (5), if Luke is born in a multiple birth and has siblings, then he lives at home (H = True).
    From (4), if Luke lives at home, then he does not live with strangers.
    Therefore, if Luke is born in a multiple birth, he does not complain about annoying siblings (C = False).
* **Case 2: ¬M ∧ ¬S**
    From (3), if Luke does not have siblings, then he does not complain about annoying siblings (C = False).

    ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
    Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
    Tom lives in a single-parent family.
    Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available.
    Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
Logical chain:
    From (4) and (5), we know Tom lives in a single-parent family (S = True) and has few resources available (R = True).

    T is True (given)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    G is below $300
Logical Chain:
    From (1), G is True.
    From (2), if Tom proves economic hardship, ETS provides financial aid.
    From (3), Tom lives in a single-parent family.
    From (4), Tom has few resources available.
    From (5), Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
    Since Tom meets the conditions for economic hardship (3, 4), Tom can apply for financial aid from ETS.
    Therefore, Tom can take the GRE test for a lower cost.
Truth Table (for G):
| G (Cost of GRE) | E (ETS Financial Aid) | S (Single-parent family) | R (Few resources) | T (Applying to GRE) |

Let:
    G: Tom takes the GRE test
    F: Tom has financial aid provided by ETS
    S: Tom lives in a single-parent family
    R: Tom has few resources available
Premises:
    G costs $205, which is cheaper than $300. (This premise does not directly relate to financial aid)
    ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. (G → F)
    Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship. (S ∨ R → F)
    Tom lives in a single-parent family. (S is True)
    Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available. (R is True)
    Tom is applying to take the GRE test. (G is True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    ¬(G ∧ F) (No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something)
Logical chain:
    From (4) and (5), we know that Tom is both in a single-parent family (S = True) and has few resources (R = True).
    From (2), if Tom proves economic hardship (which he can do due to S and R), then he can get financial aid (F = True).
    Therefore, Tom taking the GRE (G) and receiving financial aid (F) are both True.
    This means the conclusion ¬(G ∧ F) is False.
Truth Table (key possibilities):
| G (Tom takes GRE) | F (Tom has financial aid) | S (Single-parent family) | R (Few resources) | G ∧ F | ¬(G ∧ F) |

Let:
    F: Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing
    C: Peter is cleanly
    T: Peter is notably tidy
Premises:
    If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy. (F → ¬T)
    All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. (This premise does not directly relate to Peter)
    If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy. (C → T)
    If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly. (This premise does not directly relate to Peter)
    All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness. (This premise does not directly relate to Peter)
    Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. (F ∨ ¬F)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know Peter is either F ∧ C or ¬F ∧ ¬C.
    Let's consider both possibilities:
        - If Peter is F ∧ C, then from (3), Peter is T.
        - If Peter is ¬F ∧ ¬C, then from (4), Peter is not T.
Truth Table (key possibilities):

Let:
    F: Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing
    C: Peter is cleanly
    O: Peter values order and spotlessness
    D: Peter goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try
Premises:
    If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy. (F → ¬C)
    All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. (C ∧ D → F)
    If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy. (C → O)
    If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly. (O → C)
    All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness. (If O, then O)
    Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. (F ∧ C) ∨ (¬F ∧ ¬C)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Peter is either a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or he is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.
Logical Chain:
    From (5), if O is True, then O must be True.
    From (4), if O is True, then C is True.
    From (2), if C is True and D is True, then F must be False.
    From (1), if F is True, then C must be False.
    From (3), if C is True, then O is True.
    Therefore, the only way Peter can be both C and D is if he is not clumsy and does not go out frequently to find new food restaurants.
    This means Peter must be someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.
Truth Table (for Peter):
| F (Spills food) | C (Cleanly) | O (Values order) | D (Goes out frequently) |

Premises:
    If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy. (¬(C ∧ O))
    All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. (C ∧ F → ¬O)

    Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. (¬(C ∧ O) ∨ (C ∧ O))
Logical chain:
    From (6), we know Peter is either C ∧ O or ¬(C ∧ O).
    Let's analyze each possibility:
        - If Peter is C ∧ O, then from (2) we know F must be True.
        - If Peter is ¬(C ∧ O), then from (3) and (4), we know Peter is not S.
        - In both cases, we can conclude Peter is not S.

Let:
    E: Something is an evergreen
    O: Something is an object of worship
Premises:
    All fir trees are evergreens. (E → O)
    Some objects of worship are fir trees. (∃x (O(x) ∧ E(x)))
Logical Chain:
    The first premise states that all fir trees are evergreens. 
    The second premise states that there exists at least one object of worship that is also a fir tree.
    Since all fir trees are evergreens, and there exists at least one fir tree that is an object of worship, it follows that there must be at least one evergreen that is an object of worship.
    However, the premises do not state that *all* evergreens are objects of worship.

Logical Chain:

From (2), we know P ∧ M is True.
From (3), we know D is True.
From (4), we know ¬(T ∧ M) is True.
Since (2) and (4) are contradictory, we can deduce that T must be False.
Therefore, from (1), we know P must be True.

Logical Chain:
    From (2), P is True.
    From (3), M is True.
    From (4), if T were True, then M would be False, which contradicts (3). Therefore, T must be False.

Premises:
    The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas.
    Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.
    The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.
    There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines that have been donated.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico.
Logical Chain:
    From (2), we know that Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.
    From (3), we know that the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains.
    From (1), we know the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas.
    From (4), if the Harding Pegmatite Mine were in Texas, it would be in a mountain range in Texas, which contradicts the premise that there are no mountain ranges in Texas with donated mines.
    Therefore, the Harding Pegmatite Mine must be in New Mexico.
    Since the Harding Pegmatite Mine is in New Mexico and New Mexico is a state, it must be located in a mountain range in New Mexico.

    Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands. (S ∨ G ∨ D is True)
    Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. (D is True)
    If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C. (This premise is the key to the conclusion)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica (¬B)
Logical Chain:
    From (2) and (3), we know S is True.
    From (4), we know D is True.
    From (5), if S is True and D is True, then Barutin Cove is located in the South Shetland Islands.
    From (3), we know the South Shetland Islands are located in Antarctica.
    Therefore, Barutin Cove is located in Antarctica.
    The negation of this is ¬B, so the conclusion is False.

Let:
    A: Affection is positive
    L: Affection is love
Premises:
    Some affection is love (L ∧ ¬A)
    Some love is positive (L ∧ A)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Some affection is positive (A)
Logical chain:
    From (1), we know there exists at least one instance where affection is love.
    From (2), we know there exists at least one instance where love is positive.
    Since there's overlap between affection and love, it is possible that some instances of affection are also positive.

Let:
    T: John's car is a Tesla Model 3
    S: John's car is a single-seat electric car
    P: John's car can transport multiple passengers
Premises:
    If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters. (P → ¬S)
    All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers. (T → P)
    All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters. (S → S)
    All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. (S → S)
    If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. (¬T → (¬T ∧ ¬S))
Logical chain:
    We know from (2) that if T is True, then P is True.
    We also know from (3) that if S is True, then S is True.
    Therefore, if T is True, then P is True, and S is True.
    However, the premise (1) states that if P is True, then S is False.
    This creates a contradiction.
    Therefore, T must be False.

Let:
    T: John's car is a Tesla Model 3
    S: John's car is a single-seat electric car
    E: John's car is a Solo EV
Premises:
    If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters. (T ∨ ¬S)
    All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers. (T → ¬S)
    All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters. (S → S)
    All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. (E → S)
    If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. (¬T → (¬T ∨ ¬S))
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if T is True, then S must be False.
    From (3), if S is True, then S is True.
    From (4), if E is True, then S is True.
    From (5), if ¬T is True, then ¬T ∨ ¬S must be True.
    We need to analyze the possibilities:
        - If T is True, then S must be False.
        - If S is True, then E must be True.
        - If ¬T is True, then ¬T ∨ ¬S must be True.
    Therefore, the only way for E to be True is if S is True.

    Rock is Peter's pet.
    Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. (F ∨ B ∨ ¬A)
Logical Chain:

    Rock is Peter's pet.
    Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. (F ∨ B ∨ ¬A)
Conclusion to Evaluate: Rock does not have wings (¬W)
Logical chain:
    From (6) and (2), we know that if Rock is a mammal, then Rock is a monkey.
    From (1), if Rock is a mammal, then Rock is an animal.
    From (5), if Rock is an animal, then Rock can breathe.
    From (7), Rock is Peter's pet.
    From (3), Rock is either a monkey or a bird.
    We need to analyze the possibilities:
        - If Rock is a monkey:
            - From (2), Rock is a mammal.
            - From (1), Rock is an animal.
            - From (5), Rock can breathe.
            - From (4), if Rock can breathe, then Rock is a bird.
            - This creates a contradiction, so Rock cannot be a monkey.
        - If Rock is a bird:
            - From (3), Rock is either a monkey or a bird.
            - From (4), if Rock can fly, then Rock has wings.
            - From (7), Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.
            - This means Rock can fly.

Let:
    E: John is engaged
    C: John invites friends to their ceremony

    F: John has a larger family
Premises:
    All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged (E → P)
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans (C → P)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony (W → C)
    Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families (∃x (W(x) ∧ F(x)))
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans (E → ¬C ∧ ¬P)
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (F → (W ∨ C))
Conclusion to Evaluate: John has a larger family (F)
Logical chain:
    We need to determine if F is True.
    From (5), if E is True, then C and P are False.
    From (2), if C is True, then P is True.
    From (1), if P is True, then E is True.
    Therefore, if E is True, then C and P are False, creating a contradiction.
    This means E must be False.
    From (6), if F is True, then either W ∨ C is True.
    Since E is False, we cannot conclude anything about C or W.
    Therefore, F could be True or False.

    E: John is engaged
    W: John has a well-attended wedding
    F: John has a larger family
    C: John invites friends to their ceremony
Premises:
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬(F ∨ C))
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (C → W)
    All people who have a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (W → C)
    Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families. (∃x (W(x) ∧ F(x)))
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (F → (W ∨ C))
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    John does not have a larger family (¬F)
Logical Chain:
    We know from (4) that there exists at least one person with a well-attended wedding and a larger family.
    We also know from (3) that if someone has a well-attended wedding, they invite friends to their ceremony.
    Therefore, there exists at least one person who has a larger family and invites friends to their ceremony.
    From (5), if someone has a larger family, they must have either a well-attended wedding or invite friends to their ceremony.
    Since we know there's someone with a larger family who invites friends, John must also have either a well-attended wedding or invite friends to their ceremony.
    From (2), if John invites friends to their ceremony, then they have a well-attended wedding.
    Therefore, John must have a well-attended wedding.
    From (3), if John has a well-attended wedding, then they invite friends to their ceremony.
    Therefore, John invites friends to their ceremony.
    From (1), if John is engaged, then they do not invite friends to their ceremony.
    Therefore, John cannot be engaged.
    From (4), we know there's at least one person with a larger family.
    Therefore, John does not have a larger family.

Let:
    E: John is engaged
    P: John makes wedding plans
    C: John invites others to their ceremony
    F: John has a larger family
Premises:
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬(C ∨ P))
    All people who have a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (C → A)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (A → C)
    Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families. (∃x (A ∧ F))
    All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged. (P → E)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    John is engaged (E)
Logical chain:

From (4) and (3), we know that there exists a person with a well-attended wedding who has a larger family. 
From (2), if John has a well-attended wedding, then John invites others to their ceremony. 
From (1), if John is engaged, then John does not invite others to their ceremony.
Therefore, if John is engaged, then John cannot have a well-attended wedding. 
This contradicts the fact that there exists a person with a well-attended wedding.
Therefore, John is not engaged.

    R: Reinforcement learning
    T: Text summarization model
Premises:
    All machine learning algorithms are either supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning. (S ∨ U ∨ R)
    Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data.
    The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms. (T is trained with S ∨ U ∨ R)
    Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model. (R ∧ T)
    The machine learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data. (S ∧ T)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Unsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model. (U ∧ T)

Logical Chain:
    From (3) and (4), we know that T is trained with machine learning algorithms and R is not used.
    From (2), if U is True, then labeled data is not required.
    From (5), if S is True, then labeled data is required.

    E: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content
    G: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a film in the "Frozen" series
Premises:
    If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
    If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
    If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
    All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
    All movies in the "Frozen" series are family-friendly animated films.
    "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is a film.
    "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    "Hachi: A dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.
Logical Chain:
    From (6), "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is either F or G.
    From (4), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is F, then it is rated General Audience.
    From (3), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
    From (2), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is appropriate for people of all ages, then it does not contain excessive erotic and violent content.
    From (5), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is F, then it is in the "Frozen" series.
    Combining (2) and (4), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is F, then it does not contain excessive erotic and violent content.
    Combining (5) and (6), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is F, then it is in the "Frozen" series.
    Combining (2) and (6), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is not F, then it contains excessive erotic and violent content.
    Combining (5) and (6), if "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is not F, then it is not in the "Frozen" series.

Let:
    B: Breeding back
    H: Heck cattle
    A: Aurochs
    E: Animals to be bred back
Premises:
    B is a form of artificial selection.
    Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble aurochs.
    Heck cattle are animals.
    Aurochs are animals.
    Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Some Heck cattle are artificially selected.
Logical Chain:
    From (1) and (2), we know that Heck cattle are the result of breeding back.
    From (3) and (4), we know Heck cattle are animals.
    Therefore, Heck cattle are artificially selected.

Let:
    A: Aurochs are extinct
    B: Heck cattle were bred back
    C: Animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals
Premises:
    Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.
    Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.
    Heck cattle are animals.
    Aurochs are animals.
    Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Aurochs are extinct.
Logical Chain:
    From (2) and (3), we know that Heck cattle are animals bred to resemble aurochs.
    From (4), aurochs are also animals.
    From (5), we know that some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.
    However, we cannot definitively conclude that aurochs are extinct based on this information. It is possible that the aurochs still exist in some form, even if they are rare or have been reintroduced through breeding programs.

    G: Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom
Premises:
    Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election. (U → P)
    If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States. (T → U)
    A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship. (T ∨ ¬T)
    No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship. (R → ¬T)
    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom. (¬T ∧ ¬G)
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official. (U ∨ R)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Vladimir is a Russian Federation official (R)
Logical Chain:
    From (4) and (5), we know that Vladimir is not both Taiwanese and a manager at Gazprom.
    From (2), if Vladimir has United States citizenship, then he can register to vote.
    From (5), Vladimir does not have United States citizenship.
    Therefore, Vladimir cannot register to vote.

    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom. (¬(T ∨ R))
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official. (V ∨ R)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Vladimir is not a Russian federation official (¬R)
Logical Chain:
    From (4), we know ¬(T ∨ R) is True.
    From (2), if Vladimir has United States citizenship (C is True), then he can register to vote (V is True).
    From (5), if Vladimir has United States citizenship (C is True), then he cannot be a Russian federation official (R is False).
    From (3), Vladimir must have either United States citizenship (C is True) or Taiwanese citizenship (T is True).
    Since (4) states ¬(T ∨ R) is True, and we know from (2) that if C is True, then R must be False, we can conclude that Vladimir cannot be a Russian federation official (R is False).

Conclusion to Evaluate:
    It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.

104 out of 152 is correct!
Let:
    H: The mixture is a hydrocarbon
    A: The mixture is an alkane
    C: The mixture contains carbon
Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds. (H → O)
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons. (A → H)
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds. (O → Ch)
    All organic compounds contain carbon. (O → C)
    No chemical compounds contain only one element. (¬Ch → ¬(O ∧ H))
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. (O ∧ C) ∨ ¬(O ∧ C)
Logical Chain:
    From (1), if H is True, then O is True.
    From (2), if A is True, then H is True.
    From (3), if O is True, then Ch is True.
    From (4), if O is True, then C is True.
    From (5), if Ch is True, then ¬(O ∧ H) must be False.
    From (6), the mixture is either O ∧ C or ¬(O ∧ C).
    We need to determine if C is True.

Let:
    H: The mixture is a hydrocarbon
    C: The mixture contains carbon
    A: The mixture is an alkane
Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds (H → O)
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons (A → H)
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds (O → Ch)
    All organic compounds contain carbon (O → C)
    No chemical compounds contain only one element (¬Ch → ¬C)
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. (Ch ∧ C) ∨ ¬(Ch ∧ C)
Logical chain:
    From (4), if the mixture is an organic compound (O), then it contains carbon (C).
    From (3), if the mixture is an organic compound (O), then it is a chemical compound (Ch).
    From (2), if the mixture is an alkane (A), then it is a hydrocarbon (H).
    Combining (2) and (4), if the mixture is an alkane (A), then it contains carbon (C).
    From (5), if the mixture is a chemical compound (Ch), then it does not contain only one element (¬C).
    Combining (3) and (5), if the mixture is a chemical compound (Ch), then it contains more than one element.
    Therefore, if the mixture is an alkane (A), then it is not a chemical compound (Ch).
    This contradicts (3).

105 out of 154 is correct!
Let:
    H: Mixture is a hydrocarbon
    A: Mixture is an alkane
    C: Mixture contains carbon
    O: Mixture is a chemical compound
Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds (H → O)
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons (A → H)
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds (O → C)
    All organic compounds contain carbon (O → C)
    No chemical compounds contain only one element (¬(O ∧ ¬C))
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither (O ∧ ¬C) ∨ ¬(O ∧ C)
Logical Chain:
    We can simplify the premise (O ∧ ¬C) ∨ ¬(O ∧ C) to ¬(O ∧ C)
    Therefore, the mixture cannot be both a chemical compound and contain carbon.
    If the mixture contains only one element, it cannot be a hydrocarbon or an alkane.
    Therefore, if the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, it cannot be a chemical compound or an alkane.

Let:
    H: Human
    G: Greek
    M: Mortal
Premises:
    All humans are mortal (H → M)
    All Greeks are humans (G → H)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Some Greeks are mortal (¬¬∃x(G(x) ∧ M(x)))
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if G is True, then H must be True.
    From (1), if H is True, then M must be True.
    Therefore, if G is True, then M must be True.
    This means that if there exists at least one Greek (G = True), then there must be at least one mortal Greek (M = True).

Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know L is True.
    From (2), if P were True, then L would be True, which we know is already True. Therefore, P must be True.
    From (4), if D were True, then C would be True.

Let:
    M: George likes music
    A: George has access to a program
    C: George can compose
    W: George wants to compose
    D: George will compose
Premises:
    If George likes music, he wants to compose. (M → W)
    If George has access to a program, he can compose. (A → C)
    If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose. (C ∧ W → D)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If George will not compose, George can not compose. (¬D → ¬C)

Logical Chain:
    We know from (3) that if George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose. This means if D is True, then C ∧ W must also be True.
    We also know from (2) that if George has access to a program, he can compose (A → C).
    Therefore, if George will not compose (¬D), then George cannot have both access to a program (A) and wants to compose (W).
    This means George must lack access to a program (¬A) or not want to compose (¬W).
    Since George cannot have both access to a program and wants to compose if he will not compose, the statement ¬D → ¬C is true.

    ∃x (H(x))  (Some birds are hawks)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    ∀x (S(x))  (All birds swim)
Logical Chain:
    From (2), we know there exists at least one bird that is a hawk.
    From (1), we know that if something is a hawk, it does not swim.
    Therefore, there must be at least one bird that does not swim.

    B: Breaking Bad is an episode of The Bachelor
    P: Breaking Bad portrays the lives of real people
    RTV: Breaking Bad is a reality TV show
Premises:
    Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV. (This premise doesn't directly relate to Breaking Bad)
    If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
    The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
    All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
    Breaking Bad is a show.
    Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm (R)

Logical Chain:
    From (4), if Breaking Bad is a reality TV show (RTV), then it portrays the lives of real people (P).
    From (3), if Breaking Bad portrays the lives of real people (P), then it is The Bachelor (B).
    From (2), if Breaking Bad is The Bachelor (B), then it airs at 8 pm on Monday (R).
    From (6), Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show (¬RTV).
    Therefore, we know Breaking Bad cannot be on Monday at 8 pm (R).

    Breaking Bad is a show. (B)
    Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. (¬P)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. (R ∧ M)
Logical Chain:
    From (5) and (6), we know B is True and ¬P is True.
    From (2), if R were True, then B would be True, but we already know B is True.
    From (3), T is True.
    From (4), if T is True, then P is True, but we know ¬P is True.
    Therefore, R must be False.

    R: Heinrich Schmidt was part of the Nazi Reichstag
    S: Some German politician was part of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag

Premises:
    Heinrich Schmidt was a German (G = True)
    Heinrich Schmidt was also a member of the Prussian State Parliament (P = True)
    Heinrich Schmidt was also a member of the Nazi Reichstag (R = True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Some German politician was part of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag (S = True)

Logical Chain:
    From the premises, we know G, P, and R are all True.
    Since Heinrich Schmidt is German (G) and part of both the Prussian State Parliament (P) and the Nazi Reichstag (R), we can conclude that S is True.

Let:
    D: Something is a deadly disease
    S: Something is severe cancer
    B: Something is bile duct cancer
    C: Something is colorectal cancer
    L: Something comes with a low survival rate
Premises:
    If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate (D → L)
    Severe cancers are deadly diseases (S → D)
    Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer (B → S)
    All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer (C → B)
    Mild flu comes with a low survival rate (L)
    Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate (¬(B ∧ L))
Logical chain:
    We know from (2) that if something is severe cancer, then it is a deadly disease.
    From (3), if something is bile duct cancer, then it is severe cancer.
    Therefore, if something is bile duct cancer, then it is a deadly disease.
    From (5), mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
    From (6), colorectal cancer is not both bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
    Since colorectal cancer is not bile duct cancer, it cannot be a deadly disease.

Premises:
    If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. (D → ¬S)
    Severe cancers are deadly diseases. (S → D)
    Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. (B → S)
    All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. (C → B)
    Mild flu comes with a low survival rate. (M → ¬S)
    Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate. (¬(B ∧ M))
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu.
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if colorectal cancer is a severe cancer, then it is a deadly disease.
    From (3), if colorectal cancer is bile duct cancer, then it is a severe cancer.
    From (4), if colorectal cancer is Cholangiocarcinoma, then it is bile duct cancer.
    From (5), if colorectal cancer is mild flu, then it is not severe.
    From (6), colorectal cancer is not both bile duct cancer and mild flu.
    Therefore, colorectal cancer cannot be both bile duct cancer and mild flu.
    If colorectal cancer is neither bile duct cancer nor mild flu, then it must be neither a deadly disease nor a severe cancer.

Let:
    D: Something is a deadly disease
    C: Something is colorectal cancer
    B: Something is bile duct cancer
    M: Something is mild flu
Premises:
    If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. (D → L)
    Severe cancers are deadly diseases. (C → D)
    Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer. (B → C)
    All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. (Cholangiocarcinoma ⊆ B)
    Mild flu comes with a low survival rate. (M → L)
    Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate. (¬(B ∧ L))
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.
Logical Chain:
    We need to analyze the premises and conclusion to determine if they are true, false, or uncertain. 
    
    From (2), if C is True, then D is True.
    From (3), if B is True, then C is True.
    From (4), if Cholangiocarcinoma is True, then B is True.
    From (5), if M is True, then L is True.
    From (6), if C is True, then L must be False.
    
    The conclusion states that C is both B and M or all of the above. 
    Since C is True, it must be B (from 3) and L must be False (from 6). 
    Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Let:
    S: Taylor eats salads regularly

Premises:
    If Taylor eats salads regularly, then she is very conscious about her health and eating habits. (S → H)
    All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly. (H → S)
    All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes. (N → H)
    All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits. (¬P → ¬(H ∨ S))
    If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes. (This premise does not directly relate to Taylor)
    Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither. (H ∨ ¬P)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Taylor eats salads regularly (S)
Logical Chain:

From (6), we know Taylor is either H ∨ ¬P. 

Let's consider both possibilities:

* **Case 1: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home (H is True).**
    From (2), if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she eats salads regularly (S is True).

* **Case 2: Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home (H is False).**
    From (4), if Taylor disregards her physical well-being (¬P is True), then she is not very conscious about her health and eating habits.
    From (3), if Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes (N is True), then she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home (H is True). 
    From (5), if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes (N is True).
    Since Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home (H is False) and she does not disregard her physical well-being (¬P is False), then she must fulfill her daily nutritional intakes (N is True).
    From (3), if Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes (N is True), then she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home (H is True). 
    This creates a contradiction.

Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home (H) and disregards her physical well-being (P) or she did neither.
    Let's consider both possibilities:

    * **Case 1: H ∧ P**

        * From (1), if Taylor is not very conscious about her health and eating habits, then she does not eat salads regularly (¬S).
        * From (2), if Taylor does not eat salads regularly (¬S), then she did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home (¬H).
        * This contradicts our initial assumption that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home (H). Therefore, this case is not valid.

    * **Case 2: ¬H ∧ ¬P**

Let:
    H: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home
    G: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day
    N: Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes
Premises:
    All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
    All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
    All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
    All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
    If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
    Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.
Logical Chain:

From (2) and (3), we know that if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she eats salads regularly.
From (4), if Taylor is not very conscious about her health and eating habits, then she does not eat salads.
Therefore, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she is very conscious about her health and eating habits.
From (5), if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.
From (3), if Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, then she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
Therefore, if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
From (2), if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she eats salads regularly.
From (4), if Taylor is not very conscious about her health and eating habits, then she does not eat salads.
Therefore, if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she is very conscious about her health and eating habits.
From (6), Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.
From (4), if Taylor is not very conscious about her health and eating habits, then she does not eat salads.
Therefore, if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she does not disregard her physical well-being.

Premises:
    All horses have hooves (H → C)
    No humans have hooves (¬H → ¬C)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Some humans are horses (∃x (H(x) ∧ C(x)))
Logical Chain:
    The premises do not support the conclusion.
    The first premise states that all horses have hooves, and the second premise states that no humans have hooves.
    Therefore, there cannot be any humans that are also horses.

    D ∨ ¬D (Departure and arrival cannot be at the same airport)
    J is True (John flies from LGA)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    S is True (Susan flies from LGA)
Logical Chain:
    From (1), D = True.
    From (2), D ∨ ¬D is True, so ¬D must be False.
    From (3), J is True.
    Since D is True and ¬D is False, S must be True.

Premises:
    Susan flies to LGA airport (D = True, A = LGA)
    The departure and arrival can not be at the same airport (D ≠ A)
    John flies from LGA airport (J = True, L = LGA)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    John flies to LGA airport (L = LGA)
Logical Chain:
    From (2), we know that Susan's departure airport is different from her arrival airport.
    From (3), John's departure airport is LGA.
    Therefore, John's arrival airport must be different from LGA.

Let:
    A: Yuri is an American national
    B: Yuri is a professional basketball player
    J: Yuri can do jump shots
    L: Yuri leaps straight into the air
    M: Yuri activates his leg muscles
Premises:
    Some professional basketball players are not American nationals. (¬∃x (B(x) ∧ A(x)))
    All professional basketball players can do jump shots. (B → J)
    If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (J → L)
    If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L → M)
    Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (¬M)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Yuri is an American national (A)
Logical Chain:

From (5), we know Yuri does not activate his leg muscles (¬M).
From (4), if Yuri activated his leg muscles (M were True), then he would leap straight into the air (L would be True).
Since Yuri doesn't activate his leg muscles, Yuri does not leap straight into the air (L is False).
From (3), if Yuri could do jump shots (J were True), then he would leap straight into the air (L would be True).
Since Yuri doesn't leap straight into the air, Yuri cannot do jump shots (J is False).
From (2), if Yuri is a professional basketball player (B were True), then he can do jump shots (J would be True).
Since Yuri cannot do jump shots, Yuri is not a professional basketball player (B is False).
From (1), we know there are professional basketball players who are not American nationals.
However, this doesn't directly relate to whether or not Yuri is an American national.
Truth Table (Simplified):

Let:
    A: Yuri is an American
    B: Yuri is a professional basketball player
    J: Yuri can do jump shots

    M: Yuri activates his leg muscles
Premises:
    Some professional basketball players are not American nationals. (¬(B → A))
    All professional basketball players can do jump shots. (B → J)
    If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (J → L)
    If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L → M)
    Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (¬M)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, which translates to ¬(A ∧ B)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know ¬M is True.
    From (4), if M were False, then L would be False.
    From (3), if L were False, then J would be False.
    From (2), if J were False, then B would be False.
    Therefore, if M is False, then B must be False.

Let:
    A: Yuri is an American
    P: Yuri is a professional basketball player
    J: Yuri can do jump shots
    L: Yuri leaps straight into the air
    M: Yuri activates his leg muscles

Premises:
    Some professional basketball players are not American. (¬(P → A))
    All professional basketball players can do jump shots. (P → J)
    If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (J → L)
    If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L → M)
    Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (¬M)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Yuri is an American professional basketball player (A ∧ P)
Logical chain:

From (5), we know ¬M is True.
From (4), if M were True, then L would be True. Since M is False, L must be False.
From (3), if L were True, then J would be True. Since L is False, J must be False.
From (2), if J were True, then P would be True. Since J is False, P must be False.
From (1), we know there are professional basketball players who are not American. However, this doesn't directly affect whether or not Yuri is an American professional basketball player.
Truth Table (key possibilities):
| A (American) | P (Professional) | J (Jump Shots) | L (Leaps) | M (Leg Muscles) |

Let:
    A: Yuri is an American
    P: Yuri is a professional basketball player
    J: Yuri can do jump shots
    L: Yuri leaps straight into the air
Premises:
    Some professional basketball players are not American nationals. (¬∀P → ¬A)
    All professional basketball players can do jump shots. (P → J)
    If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (J → L)
    If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L → M)
    Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (¬M)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player. This translates to (¬L → (A ∧ P))
Logical Chain:
    From (4) and (5), we know M is False.
    From (3), if Yuri can do jump shots (J), then Yuri leaps straight into the air (L). Since M is False, Yuri cannot do jump shots (J is False).
    From (2), if Yuri is a professional basketball player (P), then Yuri can do jump shots (J). Since J is False, Yuri is not a professional basketball player (P is False).
    From (1), if Yuri is not American (¬A), then Yuri is not a professional basketball player (¬P). Since P is False, Yuri is not American (A is False).

Let:
    D: KiKi is a dog

    All D → ¬J
    Jane likes J
    L → J
    T → L
    KiKi is an animal
    ¬(KiKi is both ¬J and ¬L)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    T
Logical Chain:

From (4), if KiKi has legs (L is True), then KiKi jumps (J is True).
From (3), Jane likes all animals that jump (J).
From (2), if KiKi is a dog (D is True), then KiKi does not jump (J is False).
From (5), if KiKi is terricolous (T is True), then KiKi has legs (L is True).
From (4), if KiKi has legs (L is True), then KiKi jumps (J is True).
From (3), Jane likes all animals that jump (J).
Therefore, if KiKi is terricolous (T is True), then KiKi is liked by Jane.
From (1), Jane does not like any animals that bark.
From (2), if KiKi is a dog (D is True), then KiKi does not jump (J is False).
Therefore, if KiKi is a dog (D is True), then KiKi is not liked by Jane.
This creates a contradiction.
Therefore, KiKi cannot be both a dog and terricolous.
From (7), KiKi is an animal and is not both ¬J and ¬L.
From (4) and (5), if KiKi is not both ¬J and ¬L, then KiKi must be either a dog or terricolous.
Since KiKi cannot be both a dog and terricolous, KiKi must be neither.

Let:
    D: KiKi is a dog
    J: KiKi jumps
    L: KiKi has legs
    T: KiKi is terricolous
Premises:
    ¬(Jane likes any animals that bark)
    All dogs are animals that bark.
    Jane likes all animals that jump.
    If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
    If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
    KiKi is an animal.
    If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
Logical chain:
    From (5), if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs.
    From (4), if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps.
    Therefore, if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi jumps.
    From (2), if KiKi is a dog, then KiKi is an animal that barks.
    From (3), if KiKi jumps, then Jane likes KiKi.
    Therefore, if KiKi is a dog, then Jane likes KiKi.
