This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says “The theistic God is a sophist.” We also know “Some sophists reason,” which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect—He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement “The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher” is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that “William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,” we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement “William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university” remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nPeople in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPeople in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\nPeople in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\nAll people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nAll young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. \nBonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nBonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Step 1:  Let's break down the conclusion into smaller parts:
    *  "If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities" - This is a complex condition, but it essentially covers all possibilities for Bonnie's age, academic aspirations, and chaperoning status.

    * "then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community" - This is the outcome we need to evaluate.

Step 2: We are given several premises that help us analyze Bonnie's situation:
<end_of_answer>
1 out of 2 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events" that if someone in the club performs in talent shows often, they attend and are very engaged with school events.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members" that if someone is not performing in talent shows often, they are inactive and disinterested community members.

Step 3: The premise "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school" tells us that chaperones are not students.

Step 4: The premise "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances" states that inactive and disinterested members are chaperones.

Step 5:  The premise "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school" tells us that young children and teenagers wishing to further their academic careers are students.

Step 6: The premise "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school" summarizes Bonnie's situation.

Step 7: We need to analyze Bonnie's situation based on the premises.  Let's break down the "if-then" statement in the conclusion:
    -  **If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often:** This means Bonnie is either a chaperone or a frequent performer in talent shows.

    - **then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community:** This is the part we need to evaluate.

Step 8:  Let's consider the possibilities for Bonnie:

    - **Bonnie is a chaperone:** 
        - If Bonnie is a chaperone, she cannot be a student (from premise 3).
        - If Bonnie is not a student, she must be an inactive and disinterested member of the community (from premise 4).
        - Therefore, if Bonnie is a chaperone, she fits the second part of the conclusion.

    - **Bonnie is a frequent performer in talent shows:**
        - If Bonnie is a frequent performer, she attends and is very engaged with school events (from premise 1).
        - If Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, she cannot be an inactive and disinterested member of the community (from premise 2).
        - Therefore, if Bonnie is a frequent performer, she does not fit the second part of the conclusion.

Step 9: Since Bonnie must be either a chaperone or a frequent performer, and the conclusion states that Bonnie must be *both* a young child/teenager wishing to further her education *and* an inactive and disinterested member of the community, and we've shown that only the chaperone case fits the second part of the conclusion, the statement is true.

1 out of 3 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager" that if James is a manager, he will be in the company building today.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "No managers work remotely from home" that if James is a manager, he cannot work remotely from home.

Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if James is a manager, he must be in the company building.

Step 4: The premise "All employees who have lunch in the company building schedule meetings with their customers" tells us that if someone has lunch in the company building, they schedule meetings with their customers.

Step 5: The premise "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today" tells us that if someone schedules a meeting with their customers, they will be in the company building today.

Step 6:  Therefore, if James is a manager, he will be in the company building, and if he is in the company building, he will schedule a meeting with his customers, and if he schedules a meeting with his customers, he will be in the company building. This creates a chain of logic that leads to James being in the company building.

Step 7: However, we don't know for sure if James is a manager or not. The premises don't give us enough information to determine James's position at the company.

Step 8: Therefore, while the logic strongly suggests that James has lunch in the company building *if* he is a manager, we cannot definitively say for sure whether or not he does without more information about his role at the company.

Step 1: We know from the premise "James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager." that if James is in the company today, he must be a manager.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "No managers work remotely from home" and "All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home" that no managers are in other countries.
Step 3: Therefore, if James is in the company today, he cannot be a manager.
Step 4: The premise "All employees who have lunch in the company building schedule meetings with their customers" tells us that if James has lunch in the company building, he schedules meetings with his customers.
Step 5: The premise "All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today" tells us that if James schedules a meeting with his customers, he will be in the company building.
Step 6: Since we know James cannot be a manager if he is in the company building (Step 3), and managers are not in other countries (Step 2), James cannot have lunch in the company building.

The final answer is (A).
<end_of_answer>
2 out of 5 is correct!
Step 1:  We can rewrite the given premises in a more logical format:

    * P: Employee schedules a meeting with customers
    * C: Employee has lunch in the company building
    * H: Employee has lunch at home
    * R: Employee works remotely from home
    * M: Employee is a manager
    * O: Employee is in other countries
    * J: James is the employee in question

    Premises:
    * If J schedules a meeting with customers, then J goes to the company building today. (P → C)
    * If J has lunch in the company building, then J schedules a meeting with customers. (C → P)
    * J has lunch either in the company building or at home. (C ∨ H)
    * If J has lunch at home, then J works remotely from home. (H → R)
    * All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. (O → R)
    * No managers work remotely from home. (M → ¬R)
    * J will appear in the company today if and only if J is a manager. (J appears in company today ↔ M)

Step 2:  We need to analyze the conclusion:
    * "If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home." (M ∨ O → ¬(H ∨ R))
    * "If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries." (H ∨ R → ¬(M ∨ O))

Step 3:  Let's break down the first part of the conclusion (M ∨ O → ¬(H ∨ R)):
    * Assume M ∨ O is True (James is either a manager or in other countries)
    * From (6), if M is True, then ¬R must be True (Managers don't work remotely)
    * From (5), if O is True, then R must be True (Those in other countries work remotely)
    * Therefore, in either case, R must be True.
    * This contradicts the premise that if J has lunch at home, then J works remotely from home (H → R)
    * Therefore, the first part of the conclusion is True.

Step 4:  Let's break down the second part of the conclusion (H ∨ R → ¬(M ∨ O)):
    * Assume H ∨ R is True (James has lunch at home or works remotely)
    * From (6), if M is True, then ¬R must be True (Managers don't work remotely)
    * From (5), if O is True, then R must be True (Those in other countries work remotely)
    * Therefore, if either M or O is True, then the other must be False.
    * This means that if H ∨ R is True, then M ∨ O must be False.
    * Therefore, the second part of the conclusion is also True.

Step 5:  Since both parts of the conclusion are True, the overall statement is True.

4 out of 7 is correct!
Step 1: The premises state that "When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox." This means that the presence of the virus in a being *could* lead to the being getting Monkeypox.
Step 2: We also know "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals" and "Humans are mammals" and "Mammals are animals". This tells us that humans are a type of animal that can potentially carry the Monkeypox virus.
Step 3: The premises list symptoms of Monkeypox, but they do not state that *everyone* who gets Monkeypox will experience all of those symptoms. 
Step 4: The premise "People feel tired when they get the flu" connects tiredness to the flu, but it doesn't say anything about whether or not people get the flu.
Step 5: There's no information provided to suggest that *no one* gets the flu. The premises focus on the Monkeypox virus and its characteristics, not on the prevalence or absence of the flu.

5 out of 8 is correct!
Step 1: The provided premises state that "When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox." This implies that Monkeypox is a disease caused by the Monkeypox virus.
Step 2: The premises also state "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals" and "Humans are mammals" and "Mammals are animals". This means that humans can be infected by the Monkeypox virus.
Step 3: We are given that "Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness."
Step 4: The premise "People feel tired when they get the flu" is about a different disease, the flu, and does not provide any information about symptoms of Monkeypox.
Step 5:  Since there is no mention of coughing as a symptom of Monkeypox in any of the given premises, we cannot conclude that coughing is a symptom of Monkeypox.
Step 6: Therefore, the statement "Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing" is false.

6 out of 11 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that Tom is a wild turkey. 
Step 2: The premises also list six types of wild turkeys: Eastern, Osceola, Gould's, Merriam's, Rio Grande, and Ocellated.
Step 3: The premises state that Tom is *not* any of the first four types.
Step 4: The premise also states that Tom is *not* both a Merriam's and a Rio Grande wild turkey.
Step 5: Since Tom is a wild turkey but not any of the six listed types, we can conclude that Tom must be an Ocellated wild turkey.
Step 6:  There is no information provided about Joey, and no connection is made between Tom and Joey. 
Step 7: Therefore, we have no basis to conclude whether or not Joey is a wild turkey.

Step 1: We know from the premises that all elephants are mammals and all baby elephants are elephants. Therefore, all baby elephants are mammals.
Step 2:  We also know that all mammals are living beings. Therefore, all baby elephants are living beings.
Step 3: The premise states "If Jumbo is a living being, then Jumbo is not both an elephant and a mammal."
Step 4: Since we know baby elephants are both elephants and mammals, and therefore living beings, Jumbo cannot be both an elephant and a mammal if Jumbo is a living being.
Step 5: The premise also states "If Jumbo is sleepy, then Jumbo is either a baby elephant or a mammal."
Step 6: Combining steps 3 and 5, if Jumbo is sleepy, Jumbo must be either a baby elephant or a mammal, but not both.
Step 7: Therefore, the statement "If Jumbo is sleepy, then Jumbo is not both a baby elephant and a mammal" is true.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" and "If something is skittish, then it is not calm." Therefore, if Rockie is a squirrel, it cannot be calm.
Step 2: We also know "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm." This contradicts the conclusion from Step 1.
Step 3:  Since Rockie cannot be a squirrel, and the only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels, Rockie must be a rabbit.
Step 4: We are given "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute."
Step 5:  Therefore, Rockie is a cute rabbit, but we don't have enough information to definitively say whether it's a turtle.

Step 1: From the premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish," we know that if something is a squirrel spotted near the campus, it must be skittish.
Step 2: From the premise "If something is skittish, then it is not calm," we know that if something is skittish, it cannot be calm.
Step 3: The premise states "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm." This means Rockie is both spotted near the campus and calm.
Step 4: Since Rockie is both spotted near the campus and calm, Rockie cannot be a squirrel (from Steps 1 and 2).
Step 5: The premise "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels" tells us that if something is spotted near the campus, it must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.
Step 6: Since Rockie is spotted near the campus and not a squirrel (from Step 4), Rockie must be a rabbit.
Step 7: The premise "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" states that if something is a rabbit spotted near the campus, it is cute.
Step 8: Since Rockie is a rabbit spotted near the campus (from Step 6), Rockie is cute.
Step 9:  We have established that Rockie is a rabbit and not a squirrel.  
Step 10: The premises do not state that all rabbits are not turtles, so we cannot definitively conclude that Rockie is not a turtle. The conclusion is uncertain.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" and "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" that all squirrels spotted near the campus are not calm.
Step 2: We also know "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm."
Step 3: Since Rockie is spotted near the campus and is calm, Rockie cannot be a squirrel.
Step 4: The premise states "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels."
Step 5: Since Rockie is not a squirrel, Rockie must be a rabbit.
Step 6: The premise states "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute."
Step 7: Therefore, Rockie, being a rabbit spotted near the campus, must be cute.
Step 8: Thus, Rockie is either a turtle or cute.

12 out of 19 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels" that if Rockie can be spotted near the campus, it must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.
Step 2: The premise "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel" is the same as saying Rockie is either a rabbit or a squirrel.
Step 3:  Therefore, the statement "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish" is equivalent to saying "If Rockie is a rabbit or a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish".
Step 4: We are given "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute" and "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish".
Step 5: Therefore, if Rockie is a rabbit, it is cute, and if Rockie is a squirrel, it is skittish.
Step 6: This means that in either case (rabbit or squirrel), Rockie is either cute or skittish.
Step 7: Thus, the statement "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish" is true.

13 out of 20 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise “The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels,” we know that if something can be spotted near the campus, it must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.

Step 2: We are given that “Rockie can be spotted near the campus,” so Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.

Step 3:  The premise states “All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute” and “Rockie is calm.”  Since Rockie is spotted near the campus, Rockie must be a rabbit.

Step 4: The premise “All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish” tells us that if Rockie were a squirrel, then Rockie would be skittish.

Step 5: Since Rockie is a rabbit (from Step 3), and rabbits are not squirrels, Rockie cannot be skittish.

Step 6: The conclusion states “If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.” Since we know Rockie is a rabbit, and rabbits are not turtles, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: We are given that "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
Step 2: The premise states that "If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it."
Step 3: Therefore, Karen will binge-watch "Stranger Things".
Step 4: We also know that "If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it."
Step 5: So, Karen will download "Stranger Things".
Step 6: The premise states "If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa."

Step 1: We know "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
Step 2: We also know "If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it."
Step 3: Therefore, Karen will binge-watch "Stranger Things."
Step 4: The premise states "If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it."
Step 5: Combining step 3 and step 4, we can conclude that Karen will download "Stranger Things."
Step 6: The premise "Karen does not download 'Black Mirror'" tells us that Karen will not download "Black Mirror."
Step 7: We know "If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa."
Step 8: Since Karen will not download "Black Mirror" (step 6), and we know downloading is a prerequisite for sharing (step 4), Karen will not share "Black Mirror" with Lisa.

Step 1: We are given that "The theistic God is a sophist" and "All sophists are humans"
Step 2: We are also given that "All philosophers are humans"
Step 3: Therefore, if the theistic God is a sophist, then the theistic God is a human, and if the theistic God is a philosopher, then the theistic God is a human.
Step 4: Since the theistic God is both a sophist and a philosopher, we can conclude that the theistic God is a human.
Step 5: The conclusion states that the theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher, which is consistent with our derivation in Step 4.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All aliens are extraterrestrials" that if something is an alien, it is also an extraterrestrial.
Step 2: We also know "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien" meaning if someone is from Mars, they are definitely an alien.
Step 3: The premise states "No extraterrestrials are human" meaning an extraterrestrial cannot be human.
Step 4: Combining this with "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans" tells us that highly intelligent beings from Earth are not extraterrestrials.
Step 5:  The premise "Marvin is a highly intelligent being" tells us Marvin is either highly intelligent and from Earth, or highly intelligent and not from Earth.
Step 6: If Marvin is highly intelligent and from Earth, he cannot be an extraterrestrial (from step 3).
Step 7: Therefore, if Marvin is highly intelligent, he must be from somewhere other than Earth.
Step 8: The premise "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial" confirms that if Marvin is not from Earth, he is an extraterrestrial.
Step 9: We also know "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither." This means Marvin is either from both Earth and Mars, or from neither.
Step 10: If Marvin is from both Earth and Mars, he would be both human (from step 4) and an alien (from step 2), which is a contradiction.
Step 11: Therefore, Marvin must be from neither Earth nor Mars.
Step 12: Since Marvin is not from Earth, and the premise states "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial," we can conclude that Marvin is an extraterrestrial.
Step 13:  From step 1, we know that if something is an alien, it is also an extraterrestrial.
Step 14: Therefore, Marvin is also an alien.

Step 1: From the premise “All aliens are extraterrestrials,” we know that if something is an alien, it must also be an extraterrestrial.
Step 2: The premise states “If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.” This means if someone is from Mars, they are also an alien.
Step 3: We are given “No extraterrestrials are human.” This means if something is an extraterrestrial, it cannot be human.
Step 4: The premise “All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans” tells us that any highly intelligent being from Earth is also a human.
Step 5: We know “Marvin is a highly intelligent being.”
Step 6: The premise “Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither” presents two possibilities:
    - Marvin is from both Earth and Mars.
    - Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars.
Step 7:  Let's analyze each possibility:
    - **Possibility 1: Marvin is from both Earth and Mars.** 
        - If Marvin is from Earth, then by step 4, he is a human.
        - If Marvin is from Mars, then by step 2, he is an alien, and by step 1, an extraterrestrial.
        - Since Marvin cannot be both human and extraterrestrial (step 3), this possibility is ruled out.
    - **Possibility 2: Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars.**
        - If Marvin is from neither, then by step 6, he is an extraterrestrial.
        - Since Marvin is not from Earth, he cannot be a human (step 4).

Step 8:  Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars.

Step 1: From the premise "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor," we know Djokovic must be one of these two.

Step 2: We are given "If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid." This implies that if Djokovic is a famous athlete, he is also well-paid.

Step 3: We also know "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes." and "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player." Combining these, we can conclude that if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he is also a professional tennis player, and therefore an athlete.

Step 4:  "All athletes at the mixer are famous." So, if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he would be a famous athlete.

Step 5: Since we know Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor, and we've established the chain of reasoning leading to Djokovic being well-paid if he's a Grand Slam champion, we can deduce that Djokovic must be a Grand Slam champion.

Step 2: The premise also states "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player."
Step 3:  We are given that Djokovic is at the mixer.
Step 4:  Therefore, Djokovic must be either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
Step 5:  Let's analyze each possibility:
    - If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion:
        - Then, he is also a professional tennis player (from Step 2).
        -  All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes (given premise).
        -  If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid (given premise).
        -  All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens (given premise).
        -  Therefore, if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he lives in a tax haven.
    - If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor:
        - Then, Djokovic is a celebrity (given premise).
        -  If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid (given premise).
        -  All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens (given premise).
        -  Therefore, if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, he lives in a tax haven.
Step 6:  In either case (Grand Slam champion or Oscar-nominated actor), Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
Step 7:  Therefore, the statement "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven" is false.

Step 1: The premise states that "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE" and "Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine." 
Step 2: Therefore, we can conclude that Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable. 
<end_of_nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
<end_of_answer>
21 out of 34 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers" and "Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine". 
Step 2: While this implies that Roderick Strong is a leader of the stable, it doesn't explicitly state that he leads *all* members of the stable, including the Creed Brothers specifically.
Step 3:  The premise focuses on the general leadership of Roderick Strong over Diamond Mine as a whole, not a breakdown of leadership roles within the stable.
Step 4:  We can infer that Roderick Strong is at least a leader of Diamond Mine, but without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively say he leads the Creed Brothers as individuals.
Step 5:  The other premises focus on the existence of the stable, its members, and a feud with another group, but they don't provide information about specific leadership roles within Diamond Mine.
Step 6:  Therefore, the statement "Roderick Strong leads the Creed Brothers" is not directly supported by the given premises and remains uncertain.

Step 3: Therefore, Imperium has a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile.
Step 4: The conclusion states "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile."
Step 5: Since the premise states Imperium *does* have a feud with a stable including Ivy Nile, the conclusion is false.

Step 2: Therefore, we can conclude that Vienna Music Society is led by a conductor.
Step 3: We are also given that "Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society".
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that Beethoven is a conductor.
Step 5: The conclusion states that "Beethoven is not a conductor", which contradicts our derivation in step 4.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries" that if something is a Zaha Hadid design style and Max adores it, then it has interesting geometries.
Step 2: We also know "No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries".
Step 3: Combining these two, we can deduce that a Zaha Hadid design style that Max adores cannot be a brutalist building.
Step 4: The premise states "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style."
Step 5:  We are given "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative" and "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy".
Step 6: The premise "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative" tells us that if something has interesting geometries and is adored by Max, it must be both a brutalist building and evocative.
Step 7:  Since we know that Zaha Hadid designs adored by Max cannot be brutalist, and Kelly Wearstler designs adored by Max are not necessarily brutalist, we cannot conclude that any design by Max is a brutalist building.

Step 1: The premise states that "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative" and "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy".
Step 2: Therefore, we can conclude that all of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are both evocative and dreamy.
Step 3: The premise also states that "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style".
Step 4: So, if a design by Max that he adores is a Kelly Wearstler design style, then it must be both evocative and dreamy.
Step 5:  The premise "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative" does not directly contradict the fact that a design can be both evocative and dreamy.
Step 6:  Therefore, we can conclude that a design by Max is evocative and dreamy.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek" and "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male" that all players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female and lost to Iga Świątek, or male and lost to Rafael Nadal.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022".
Step 3: Combining these facts, Coco Gauff must either be female and lost to Iga Świątek, or male and lost to Rafael Nadal.
Step 4: The premise "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022" tells us that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Nadal, then she cannot be a male player at Roland Garros 2022.
Step 5: Since Coco Gauff must be either female and lost to Iga Świątek, or male and lost to Rafael Nadal, and the premise states that if she is either of those, she cannot be a male player at Roland Garros 2022, we can conclude that Coco Gauff must be female and lost to Iga Świątek.
Step 6: We know from the premise "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis."
Step 7: Since Coco Gauff must be ranked highly by the WTA (because she lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022), we can conclude that Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis.

Step 4: Therefore, Coco Gauff must be either a female tennis player who lost to Iga Świątek or a male tennis player who lost to Rafael Nadal.

Step 1: From the premises "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek" and "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male," we can deduce that all players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
Step 2: From the premise "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis," we know that if someone is ranked highly by the WTA, they are one of the most active players in major tennis.
Step 3: From the premise "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association," we know that everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is also one of the most active players in major tennis (from Step 2).
Step 4: Therefore, all players at Roland Garros 2022 are both one of the most active players in major tennis and lost to Iga Świątek.
Step 5: The conclusion states "Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis."
Step 6: Since we know from Step 4 that all players at Roland Garros 2022 are both one of the most active players in major tennis and lost to Iga Świątek, the conclusion that Coco Gauff is *not* both is false.

Step 1: The premise states "All cats are mammals." This means if something is a cat, it must also be a mammal.
Step 2: The premise also states "Some pets are not mammals." This means there exist pets that are not mammals.
Step 3:  These two premises do not mean that *all* pets are not mammals. 
Step 4:  It's possible to have pets that are mammals (like cats) and pets that are not mammals (like fish or birds).
Step 5: The conclusion states "No pets are cats," which means *all* pets must be non-mammals.
Step 6: Since the premises don't definitively state that *all* pets are non-mammals, the conclusion is not true.
Step 7:  The conclusion is also not false because we know some pets are not mammals, and we can't definitively say they are all non-mammals.

Step 3: Since we know all streaming services are digital and not analog, and the premise states "Every printed text is analog media," we can conclude that if 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be printed text.
Step 4: Therefore, the statement "1984 is printed text" is false.

Step 2: We also know "All streaming services are digital media" and "No digital media are analog." Therefore, if 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be analog.
Step 3:  We are given "Every printed text is analog media." This means if 1984 is a hardcover book (as implied in step 1), then it must be analog.
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we see that if 1984 is a streaming service, it cannot be a hardcover book, and if it is a hardcover book, it must be analog. This creates a contradiction.

Step 2:  We also know that international students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa (I ∨ J).

Step 3:  The premise states that if an international student has an F1 visa and wants to work in the US, they need to apply for CPT or OPT (F1 ∧ C → CPT ∨ OPT).

Step 4: Since Mike needs to apply for CPT (C = True), and we know F1 visa holders need to apply for CPT or OPT if they want to work in the US, it is possible that Mike has an F1 visa.

Step 5: However, it is also possible that Mike has a J1 visa and has a different work arrangement that doesn't require CPT.

Step 1: We know from the premise "International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa" that Mike, as an international student in the US, must have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US" that if Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work in the US, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT.

Step 3: The premise states "Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US." This implies that Mike wants to work in the US and therefore, if he has an F1 visa, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT (from step 2).

Step 4:  However, the premises do not state that Mike *cannot* have a J1 visa. It only states that if he has an F1 visa, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT.

Step 5: Therefore, while the premises give us information about the requirements for working in the US with an F1 visa, they do not rule out the possibility that Mike has a J1 visa. 

Step 6:  We cannot definitively conclude that Mike has a J1 visa based on the given information.

Step 3: We are given that "Alligators are not domesticated animals" and "Ted is an alligator." Therefore, Ted cannot be a domesticated animal.
Step 4: Since Ted is an alligator and not a domesticated animal, and Brown Swiss cows are domesticated animals, Ted cannot be a Brown Swiss cow.
Step 5:  We know some pets are Brown Swiss cows, but we don't know if Ted is one of them. There might be other pets that are not Brown Swiss cows.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says “The theistic God is a sophist.” We also know “Some sophists reason,” which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect—He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement “The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher” is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that “William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,” we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK.

51 out of 69 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states that "Badults is a British Sitcom series starring members of Pappy's." This confirms that at least one member of Pappy's has starred in a show.
Step 2: The premise also states that "Badults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three." This confirms that a show starring members of Pappy's has been piloted on BBC Three.
Step 3: The conclusion states that "No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three." This is a stronger claim than what the premises establish. 
Step 4: While we know a show with Pappy's members was piloted on BBC Three, we don't know if they've starred in anything on BBC Two.  
Step 5: The premises provide no information to rule out the possibility that members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloted on BBC Two. 
Step 6:  Therefore, the statement "No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three" is not definitively true based on the given information.

Step 1: The premise states "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund."
Step 2: We also know "KO is a mature stock."
Step 3: Therefore, KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 4: While the premises establish that KO is a mature stock and thus suitable for a retirement fund, they do not definitively state whether or not KO is a stock.
Step 5: However, it is a reasonable assumption that if something is a "mature stock," it is also a type of "stock" in general.
Step 6:  Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it is highly probable that KO is a stock.
<end_of_nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (A).
<end_of_answer>
51 out of 71 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund" and "KO is a mature stock" that KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund" that if a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 3:  The premise "All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation" states that all growth stocks are bought with the intention of rapid price appreciation.
Step 4: Combining steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that all growth stocks are not suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 5: Since KO is a mature stock and mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds (Step 1), KO cannot be a growth stock (Step 4). 
Step 6:  The conclusion states that KO is both a stock and a growth stock. Since we know KO is not a growth stock (Step 5), the conclusion is false. 
<end_of_nl_cot>
<answer>
The final answer is (B).
<end_of_answer>
52 out of 72 is correct!
Step 1: We are given that "All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation."
Step 2: We are also given that "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund."
Step 3: Combining these two, we can deduce that all growth stocks are not suitable for a retirement fund.
Step 4: The premise states that "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund" and "KO is a mature stock".
Step 5: Therefore, KO is a suitable stock for a retirement fund.
Step 6: We are asked to evaluate the statement "If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile."
Step 7: Since KO is a mature stock and thus suitable for a retirement fund, it cannot be a growth stock (from Step 3).
Step 8:  We don't have information to definitively say whether KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation or not. 
Step 9: Therefore, the statement "If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile" is true. This is because the "if" part of the statement cannot be true (KO is not a growth stock), making the entire conditional statement true.

Step 1: The premise states that "All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34."
Step 2: We also know that "Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul."
Step 3: The premise "Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul" tells us that Joe's plate must begin with the number 34.
Step 4: The premise "Tom's license plate begins with the number 35" is given.
Step 5: We also have the premise "If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34."
Step 6: Combining steps 4 and 5, we can conclude that Tom's license plate does not begin with the number 34.
Step 7: From step 2, we know that plates not beginning with 34 are not from Istanbul.
Step 8: Therefore, Tom's license plate, which does not begin with 34, cannot be from Istanbul.

Step 1: We know from the premise "Hannah is at Mary's school" that Hannah is indeed at Mary's school.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition" and the fact that Hannah works in student jobs on campus that Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
Step 3: The premise states "if people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus" and "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters" and "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls".
Step 4: We also know "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition". This implies that if Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is not a picky eater.
Step 5: Therefore, we can conclude that Hannah is not a picky eater.
Step 6: Combining steps 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can conclude that Hannah is at Mary's school, is not a picky eater, and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.

56 out of 77 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Hannah is at Mary's school" that Hannah is indeed at Mary's school.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition" and "Hannah works in student jobs on campus" that Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

Step 3: The premise states "If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus." Since we know Hannah works in student jobs on campus, this means she either orders takeout frequently or does not.

Step 4: We are given "People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes."  

Step 5:  We also know "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters" and "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls."

Step 6:  The premise "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition" is a bit complex. It means that if Hannah needs to earn money for tuition, she is not picky.

Step 7: Combining steps 2, 3, 4, and 5, we can deduce that Hannah either orders takeout frequently or enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes. 

Step 8: If Hannah orders takeout frequently, then she works in student jobs on campus, and thus is not picky (from step 6).

Step 9: If Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then she is not picky and spends a lot of time in the dining halls (from steps 4 and 5).

Step 10: Therefore, in either case, Hannah is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.

58 out of 80 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "No baked sweets are spicy" and "All cupcakes are baked sweets" that all cupcakes are not spicy.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All mala hotpots are spicy" that all mala hotpots are spicy.
Step 3: The premise states that "Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets." This means they could be any one of these three things, but not a combination.
Step 4: Since cupcakes are not spicy (from Step 1) and dried Thai chilies could be spicy, they cannot be cupcakes.
Step 5: Therefore, dried Thai chilies must be either a mala hotpot or not a baked sweet.
Step 6: We cannot definitively conclude that dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot based on the given premises. 
Step 7: The premise states that dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets, but it does not state that they must be a mala hotpot if they are spicy.
Step 8:  Therefore, while dried Thai chilies could be a mala hotpot, it is not a guaranteed conclusion.

59 out of 81 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "No baked sweets are spicy" and "All cupcakes are baked sweets," we can deduce that all cupcakes are not spicy.
Step 2: From the premise "All mala hotpots are spicy," we know that if something is a mala hotpot, it is spicy.
Step 3: From the premise "All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes," we can deduce that all products from Baked by Melissa are not spicy (following from Step 1).
Step 4: The premise "Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets" presents three possibilities:
    - Dried Thai chilies are spicy.
    - Dried Thai chilies are mala hotpots.
    - Dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets.
Step 5: Since we know all products from Baked by Melissa are not spicy (Step 3), and Dried Thai chilies are either spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets, Dried Thai chilies cannot be products of Baked by Melissa.
Step 6: Therefore, the statement "Dried Thai chilies are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets" is true.

60 out of 82 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "No baked sweets are spicy" and "All cupcakes are baked sweets" that all cupcakes are not spicy.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All mala hotpots are spicy" that mala hotpots are spicy.
Step 3: The premise states "Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets." This means dried Thai chilies are either spicy, mala hotpots, or not baked sweets.
Step 4: Since all cupcakes are not spicy (from Step 1), and dried Thai chilies are either spicy or mala hotpots (from Step 3), dried Thai chilies cannot be cupcakes.
Step 5:  Therefore, the statement "Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa" is false.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations" and "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews" that all restaurants with a rating greater than four have not received many negative reviews.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents" and "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four" that the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four.

Step 3: Therefore, we can conclude that the Hamden Plaza Subway store has not received many negative reviews.

Step 4: The conclusion states "If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service." This statement is a contradiction because we know the Hamden Plaza Subway store has not received many negative reviews.

Step 5:  Therefore, the conclusion is false.

62 out of 84 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents," we know that either the store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents, or both.

Step 2: From the premise "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four," we know that if the store is popular among local residents, it also has a rating greater than four.

Step 3: Therefore, we can conclude that the store either has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents, or both.

Step 4: From the premise "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations," we know that if the store has a rating greater than four, it is listed in Yelp’s recommendations.

Step 5: From the premise "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews," we know that if the store is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, it has not received many negative reviews.

Step 6: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that if the store has a rating greater than four, it has not received many negative reviews.

Step 7: Therefore, the store either provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews, as the premises do not provide information to determine if the store provides take-out service.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations" that if a restaurant has a rating greater than four, it is listed in Yelp's recommendations.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews" that if a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, it has not received many negative reviews.
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if a restaurant has a rating greater than four, it has not received many negative reviews.
Step 4: The premise states "The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents."
Step 5: We also know "All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four."
Step 6: Therefore, if the Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents, it also has a rating greater than four.
Step 7:  From step 3, we know that if a restaurant has a rating greater than four, it has not received many negative reviews.
Step 8: The premise "Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews" tells us that there are restaurants that do not provide take-out service and have many negative reviews.
Step 9: However, this premise does not state that *all* restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
Step 10:  We cannot definitively conclude that the Hamden Plaza Subway store does not provide take-out service based on the given information. 
Step 11: The conclusion states that the Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service, but we have no direct evidence to support this claim.

Step 1: The premise states that "When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge."
Step 2: We also know that "If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter."
Step 3: Combining these two premises, we can conclude that when a person reads a book, they become smarter.
Step 4: The premise "Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau" tells us that Harry gained knowledge from reading this book.
Step 5: Therefore, we can conclude that Harry has become smarter.
Step 6: Since Harry is a specific person who has become smarter, we can generalize that a smarter person has gained knowledge.

The final answer is (A).
<end_of_answer>
67 out of 91 is correct!
Step 1: The premise states "A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task." This sets up the fundamental options for what a natural language processing task can be.
Step 2: We also have "If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task." This tells us that if the output is text, it's generation.
Step 3:  "Machine translation is a natural language processing task." This confirms that machine translation falls under the umbrella of natural language processing.
Step 4:  "The output of machine translation is a text sequence." This tells us that the output of machine translation is indeed text.
Step 5:  Combining steps 2 and 4, we can conclude that since machine translation produces text, it must be a language generation task.
Step 6:  The conclusion states "Machine translation is a language understanding task."  Since we've established that machine translation is a language generation task, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: From the premises "Pets are allowed in some managed buildings" and "The Olive Garden is a managed building", we know that pets are allowed in The Olive Garden.
Step 2: From the premise "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet," we can deduce that people are allowed to move in with pets in The Olive Garden.
Step 3: We are given that "Fluffy is Tom's cat" and "Cats are pets". Therefore, Tom wants to move in with a pet (Fluffy).
Step 4: From the premise "A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building," we know that a deposit is required to rent in The Olive Garden.
Step 5: From the premise "The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more," we know the deposit at The Olive Garden will be at least $2000.
Step 6: From the premise "The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000" and "$2000 is more than $1500", we know the deposit will be more than $1500.
Step 7: From the premise "Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500," we can see that Tom will not rent in The Olive Garden because the deposit is more than $1500.

Step 1: We know that pets are allowed in some managed buildings and that the Olive Garden is a managed building.
Step 2: We also know that if a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
Step 3: Therefore, people are allowed to move in with pets at the Olive Garden.
Step 4: We know that Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
Step 5: The security deposit at the Olive Garden is $2000, which is more than $1500.
Step 6: Since the security deposit at the Olive Garden is not no more than $1500, Tom will not rent an apartment there.
Step 7: Therefore, Tom is not allowed to move into an apartment at the Olive Garden with Fluffy.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All legal entities have legal obligations."
Step 2: We also know that "All business organizations are legal entities" and "All companies are business organizations."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that all companies are legal entities.
Step 4: The premise "All private companies are companies" tells us that if something is a private company, it is also a company.
Step 5: Therefore, all private companies are legal entities.
Step 6: The premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company" means that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, it cannot be created under law.
Step 7:  We know that all private companies are legal entities (from step 5), so the Harvard Weekly Book Club must be a legal entity.
Step 8:  Therefore, the Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations (from step 1).

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says “The theistic God is a sophist.” We also know “Some sophists reason,” which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons.

Step 4: The premise "All business organizations are legal entities" and "All companies are business organizations" tell us that all companies are legal entities.
Step 5: Therefore, all companies have legal obligations.
Step 6: The premise "All private companies are companies" tells us that all private companies are also companies.
Step 7: Therefore, all private companies have legal obligations.
Step 8:  The premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company"  means that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity, it cannot be a private company.
Step 9: However, we know from steps 3-7 that all legal entities are business organizations, and all companies are business organizations, and all private companies are companies. Therefore, if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity, it must be a company, and if it is a company, it must be a business organization.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All companies are business organizations" and "All business organizations are legal entities" that if something is a company, it is also a legal entity.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All legal entities are created under law" that if something is a legal entity, it is created under law.
Step 3: Combining these, we can conclude that if something is a company, it is both created under law and a legal entity.
Step 4:  The premise states "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company." This means if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, it cannot be a private company.
Step 5:  The conclusion states "If the Harvard Weekly Book club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law."  
Step 6:  Since we know that all companies are legal entities and all legal entities are created under law, we can say that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a company, it is both a legal entity and created under law.
Step 7:  Therefore, the conclusion "If the Harvard Weekly Book club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law" is true because if it is a private company, it must also be a company, and we know from step 6 that all companies are both legal entities and created under law.

73 out of 99 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates."
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All vertebrate animals have a backbone" and "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating." that if something is a vertebrate, it has a backbone and reproduces by male-and-female mating.
Step 3: The premise "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" tells us that if something is a bee, it does not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
Step 4:  Therefore, if Harry is a bee, he cannot be a vertebrate.
Step 5: Since Harry is a bee, he must be an invertebrate.
Step 6: We also know from the premise "All queen bees are bees" that if Harry is a queen bee, he is also a bee.
Step 7: Therefore, Harry is either an invertebrate or a queen bee.

74 out of 100 is correct!
Step 1: We can simplify the premise "All animals with backbones are vertebrates" to "If something is an animal with a backbone, then it is a vertebrate."
Step 2: We also know "All vertebrates reproduce by male-and-female mating" and "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating."
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that if something is both an animal with a backbone and a bee, it cannot exist.
Step 4: Since Harry is a bee (premise), Harry cannot be an animal with a backbone.
Step 5:  Therefore, Harry must be either an invertebrate or a vertebrate.
Step 6:  The conclusion states "If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee."
Step 7:  Since Harry cannot be both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, the first part of the conditional statement is false.
Step 8:  Therefore, the conclusion holds true regardless of whether Harry is a vertebrate or an invertebrate.

Step 1: We know from the premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings" that if someone is born in a multiple birth with siblings, they spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with them.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth" that if people have siblings who were born together, then they were in a multiple birth.

Step 3: The premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" tells us about Luke's birth and living situation, but it doesn't definitively state whether he has siblings or not.

Step 4:  Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings based on the given information. 

Step 5: The conclusion states that Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings, but the premises do not provide enough information to confirm or deny this.

75 out of 102 is correct!
Step 1: From the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers," we can analyze the two possibilities:
    - **Possibility 1:** Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers. This contradicts the premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers" since living at home implies not living with strangers. Therefore, this possibility is ruled out.
    - **Possibility 2:** Luke is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. This means he does not live with his siblings.

Step 2: From the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home," we know that if Luke spent a lot of time with his siblings, he would often live at home.

Step 3: Since we know Luke does not live with his siblings (from Possibility 2), he cannot spend a lot of time with them.

Step 4:  From the premise "If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth," we know that if Luke has siblings born together, then he was born in a multiple birth.

Step 5: Since we know Luke does not live with his siblings, he cannot have siblings born together.

Step 6:  Therefore, Luke cannot complain about annoying siblings because he does not have siblings he lives with.

76 out of 103 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers" that Luke cannot be born in a multiple birth and live with strangers.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers" that if Luke lives at home, he cannot live with strangers.

Step 3: Combining these two facts, we can conclude that Luke does not live at home.

Step 4: We are given the premise "If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home." Since Luke does not live at home, he cannot spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.

Step 5: We are also given the premise "People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings." Since Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, he cannot be born in a multiple birth.

Step 6: We are left with the conclusion that Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.

Step 7:  While we know Luke is not born in a multiple birth, we don't know if he has siblings or if he complains about annoying siblings. 

Step 8: Therefore, the statement "Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings" is true.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All Yale dormitories are located on the Yale campus" and "All Yale buildings located on the Yale campus are open to students." Therefore, all Yale dormitories are open to students.
Step 2: We also know that "All Yale buildings managed by Yale Housing are dormitories" and "All Yale buildings operated by Yale Housing staff are managed by Yale Housing." Therefore, all Yale buildings operated by Yale Housing staff are dormitories.
Step 3: The premise states that Harkness is "either a Yale building operated by Yale Housing staff, or it is located on York Street."
Step 4:  If Harkness is a Yale building operated by Yale Housing staff, then it is a dormitory (from Step 2).
Step 5: If Harkness is located on York Street, we don't have enough information to determine if it's a dormitory.
Step 6:  Therefore, the statement "Harkness is a dormitory" is true if Harkness is a Yale building operated by Yale Housing staff, and uncertain if it is located on York Street.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship" and "Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship."
Step 2: We also know that "Tom lives in a single-parent family" and "Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them."
Step 3: Combining these premises, we can conclude that Tom can prove economic hardship and thus is eligible for financial aid from ETS.
Step 4: The conclusion states "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something." This is a very strong statement claiming that *no one* receives financial aid for the GRE.
Step 5: Since we have established that at least one person (Tom) taking the GRE is eligible for financial aid, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: The premises state that if someone spills a lot of food on their clothing, they are not notably tidy.
Step 2: We also know that clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try spill a lot of food on their clothing.
Step 3: Combining these, we can conclude that clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are not notably tidy.
Step 4: The premise states that Peter is either someone who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or someone who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
Step 5: This means Peter must fit into one of these two categories.
Step 6: If Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, he is not notably tidy (from Step 3).
Step 7: If Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing, he is cleanly (from the premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy").

Step 1:  From the premises, we know that "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing."
Step 2:  We also know that "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy."
Step 3: Combining these two, we can conclude that clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are not notably tidy.
Step 4: The premise states "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy."
Step 5:  We also have "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly."
Step 6:  Therefore, if someone values order and spotlessness, they are notably tidy.
Step 7: The premise "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" tells us that if a family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then every member of that family values it.
Step 8:  Finally, the premise states "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly."
Step 9:  Let's analyze each possibility for Peter:
    - **Possibility 1:** Peter spills a lot and is clean. This contradicts our derivation in step 3, as clumsy foodies are not notably tidy.
    - **Possibility 2:** Peter does not spill a lot and is not clean. This means Peter is not a clumsy foodie (from step 1) and does not value order and spotlessness (from step 5 and 6).
Step 10: Since the first possibility is not valid, we are left with the second possibility, where Peter does not spill a lot and is not clean.
Step 11: The conclusion states "Peter is either a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or he is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness."  We have established that Peter is neither a clumsy foodie nor values order and spotlessness.
Step 12: Therefore, the conclusion is false.

80 out of 109 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premise "If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy" that spilling a lot of food on one's clothing leads to a lack of tidiness.
Step 2: We also know "All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing." This means clumsy foodies who frequently eat out are guaranteed to be not notably tidy.
Step 3: The premise "If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy" establishes a link between cleanliness and tidiness.
Step 4:  "If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly" connects valuing order and spotlessness with cleanliness.
Step 5:  "All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness" states that if a family prioritizes order and spotlessness, then its members do too.
Step 6: The premise "Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly" presents Peter with two possibilities.

Step 7:  Let's analyze each possibility for Peter:
    - **Possibility 1:** Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly. 
        - This contradicts our findings in steps 2 and 3 because if Peter spills a lot, he's not notably tidy, and if he's cleanly, he is notably tidy.
    - **Possibility 2:** Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
        - This means Peter is not a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try (from step 2).
        - Since Peter is not cleanly, he does not value order and spotlessness (from steps 3 and 4).
        -  Therefore, his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness either (from step 5).

Step 8:  We've shown that Peter cannot be a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently and also value order and spotlessness. Therefore, the statement "Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness" is true.

Step 1: The premise states "All fir trees are evergreens." This means that if something is a fir tree, it is also an evergreen.

Step 2: The premise also tells us "Some objects of worship are fir trees." This means there exist at least some things that are both fir trees and objects of worship.

Step 3:  Since all fir trees are evergreens (Step 1), and we know some things are both fir trees and objects of worship (Step 2), it logically follows that some evergreens are objects of worship.

Step 4: However, the conclusion states "Some evergreens are *not* objects of worship." This means there must be some evergreens that are *not* objects of worship.

Step 5:  Because we know some evergreens *are* objects of worship (Step 3), and the conclusion states some are *not*, the statement "Some evergreens are not objects of worship" must be true.

    * Premise 1: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
    * Premise 2: All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
    * Premise 3: All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
    * Premise 4: All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
    * Premise 5: If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.

Step 2: We can use these premises to deduce some possibilities:
    * From (2) and (1), we know that all Tesla Model 3 are not one-seaters.
    * From (3) and (4), we know that all Solo EV cars are one-seaters.
    * From (5), we know that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be a single-seat electric car.

Step 3:  Therefore, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it must be something other than a single-seat electric car.

Step 4:  This leaves us with the conclusion that John's car must be a Tesla Model 3.

Step 3:  Since "Peter's birds can fly," if Rock can fly, then Rock must be a bird (from the premise "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.").
Step 4:  We also know "All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals." and "All monkeys are mammals." Therefore, if Rock is a monkey, it is also an animal.
Step 5:  The premise "All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe" tells us that if Rock is an animal (and therefore a monkey), then Rock can breathe.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "All monkeys are mammals" that if something is a monkey, it is also a mammal.
Step 3: The premise states "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds." This means Rock, being Peter's pet, must be either a monkey or a bird.
Step 4:  If Rock is a monkey, then by steps 2 and 3, Rock is also a mammal and therefore an animal (step 1).
Step 5: The premise "All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe" tells us that if Rock is an animal (as derived in step 4), then Rock can breathe.
Step 6: The premise "If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings" states that if something is Peter's pet and can fly, it has wings.
Step 7: The premise "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe" presents three possibilities for Rock.
Step 8:  We've established that if Rock is a monkey, it can breathe (step 5).  This means Rock cannot be the case where "Rock cannot breathe."

Step 6: Since John cannot be engaged and still invite others to his ceremony, the only way for this premise to hold true is if John has a well-attended wedding.
Step 7:  We are given "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony".
Step 8:  Therefore, if John has a well-attended wedding, he must invite others to his ceremony.
Step 9:  We are back to step 4, where we established that if John invites others to his ceremony, he cannot be engaged.
Step 10:  This creates a contradiction, meaning the premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" cannot be true if John has a larger family.
Step 11:  Therefore, John cannot have a larger family.

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says “The theistic God is a sophist.” We also know “Some sophists reason,” which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons.

94 out of 129 is correct!
Step 1: We are given "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged." This means that if someone is making wedding plans, they must be engaged.

Step 2: We are also given "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans." This means that if someone invites others to their wedding ceremony, they are making wedding plans.

Step 3: Combining these two, we can say that if someone invites others to their wedding ceremony, they must be engaged.

Step 4: The premise states "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony." This means that if someone has a well-attended wedding, they invite others to their ceremony.

Step 5:  Therefore, if someone has a well-attended wedding, they must be engaged (from our derivation in step 3).

Step 6:  We are given "Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families." This tells us there's a connection between having a well-attended wedding and having a larger family, but it doesn't state that *everyone* with a well-attended wedding has a larger family.

Step 7:  The premise "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans" tells us that if John is engaged, he won't invite friends and make wedding plans.

Step 8: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends.

Step 9: We can see a potential conflict here. If John is engaged (Step 7), he won't invite friends and make wedding plans (Step 7). But if John has a larger family (Step 8), he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends (Step 8).

Step 10: This means John cannot be engaged *and* have a larger family at the same time, as it would violate the premises.

Step 11: Therefore, the statement "John is engaged" cannot be true.

94 out of 130 is correct!
Step 1: We know from the premises that "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged." and "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans." Therefore, if John invites others to his ceremony, he must be engaged.

Step 2: We also know from the premise "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans." This contradicts our derivation in Step 1. 

Step 3:  Therefore, John cannot invite others to his ceremony.

Step 4:  The premise "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony" tells us that if John had a well-attended wedding, he would have invited others to his ceremony, which we've established he does not do.

Step 5:  Therefore, John cannot have a well-attended wedding.

Step 6: The premise "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony" tells us that if John has a larger family, he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony. Since we know he doesn't invite friends to his ceremony and can't have a well-attended wedding, John cannot have a larger family.

Step 7: We have now concluded that John does not invite others to his wedding and does not have a larger family.

Step 1: The premise states "Platypuses are mammals."

Step 3: The premise "Platypuses have no teeth" tells us that platypuses are *not* included in the group of mammals that have teeth.
Step 4: The fact that some mammals have teeth does not mean *all* mammals do. 
Step 5:  The conclusion states "Platypuses are reptiles." There is no logical connection provided between being a mammal and being a reptile.
Step 6: We can't conclude that platypuses are reptiles based on the given information. The premises focus on the relationship between platypuses and mammals, but they don't provide any information about their classification as reptiles.

99 out of 135 is correct!
Step 1: The premises establish that "Plungers suck," "Vacuums suck," and "Vampires suck." This creates a shared characteristic of "sucking" among these three distinct entities.

Step 2: The premise "Space is a vacuum" connects space to the concept of a vacuum.

Step 3: The premise "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck" introduces a contrasting concept, highlighting that not everything that is a vacuum "sucks" in the same way as plungers and vacuums.

Step 4: The conclusion states "Space is a vampire." This statement attempts to connect space to the concept of a vampire solely based on the shared characteristic of "sucking."

Step 5: The provided premises do not offer any logical basis for equating a vacuum with a vampire. While both may share the word "suck," the meaning and context are vastly different.

Step 6: The conclusion is a leap of logic with no supporting evidence from the given premises.

Step 7: Therefore, the statement "Space is a vampire" is not supported by the provided information and is considered false.

<answer>
The final answer is (B).
<end_of_answer>
99 out of 136 is correct!
Step 1: The premises state that "Plungers suck" and "Vacuums suck." This establishes a pattern that objects classified as plungers or vacuums possess the characteristic of "sucking."
Step 2:  The premise "Vampires suck" introduces a different meaning of "suck," unrelated to the previous examples.
Step 3: The premise "Space is a vacuum" connects the concept of "vacuum" to space, but this is a scientific definition and doesn't directly relate to household appliances.
Step 4: The premise "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck" provides a specific example of a household appliance that does not possess the "sucking" characteristic.
Step 5:  Since we have a clear example of a household appliance that does not "suck," the statement "If something is a household appliance, it sucks" is false.

Step 1: We know that "Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning."
Step 2: We also know that "Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data."
Step 3: The premise states that "The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms."
Step 4:  We are given that "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model."
Step 5: Combining steps 3 and 4, we can deduce that the state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained using either supervised learning or unsupervised learning.
Step 6:  The premise states that "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data." This means the algorithm used for training the state-of-the-art model must be supervised learning, as unsupervised learning does not require labeled data (Step 2). 
Step 7: Therefore, the statement "Supervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" is true.

101 out of 138 is correct!
Step 1: We know "The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms" and "Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning." This means the training model falls into one of these three categories.
Step 2: We also know "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data" and "Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data." This implies the training model cannot be unsupervised.
Step 3: Finally, we know "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model." This leaves us with only supervised learning as a possibility. 
Step 4: Therefore, the state-of-the-art text summarization model must be trained with a supervised learning algorithm.
Step 5: Since the conclusion states "Unsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model," and we know it cannot be unsupervised, the conclusion is false.

Step 1: From the premise “All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience” and “All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films,” we can conclude that all movies in the “Frozen” series are rated General Audience.

Step 2: From the premise “If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages,” we can conclude that all movies rated General Audience are appropriate for people of all ages.

Step 3: From the premise “If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents,” we can conclude that children can watch all movies rated General Audience without guidance from their parents.

Step 4: From the premise “If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents,” we can conclude that if a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, it is not appropriate for people of all ages.

Step 5: Combining steps 2 and 4, we know that a film is either rated General Audience and thus appropriate for people of all ages, or it contains excessive erotic and violent content and is not appropriate for people of all ages.

Step 6: From the premise “‘Hachi: A dog’s Tale’ is a film and ‘Hachi: A dog’s Tale’ is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages,” we can conclude that ‘Hachi: A dog’s Tale’ is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages.

Step 7: Since ‘Hachi: A dog’s Tale’ is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages, and we know from steps 1-5 that a film is either rated General Audience and thus appropriate for people of all ages, or it contains excessive erotic and violent content and is not appropriate for people of all ages, we can conclude that ‘Hachi: A dog’s Tale’ either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the “Frozen” series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the “Frozen” series.

Step 1: From the premise "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom," we know that Vladimir does not hold Taiwanese citizenship.
Step 2: From the premise "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship," we can deduce that if Vladimir does not hold Taiwanese citizenship, then he must hold US citizenship.
Step 3: The premise "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States" states that if Vladimir is a US citizen, he can register to vote in the US.
Step 4: The premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election" tells us that if someone can register to vote in the US, they can participate in the 2024 election.
Step 5: The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" does not provide any information about Vladimir's citizenship or his status as a Russian Federation official.
Step 6: Therefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that Vladimir is a US citizen and can participate in the 2024 US presidential election, but we have no information to conclude whether or not he is a Russian Federation official.

Step 1: From the premise "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship," we know that if someone is a Russian Federation official, they cannot be a Taiwanese citizen.

Step 2: From the premise "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship," we know that a person must belong to one of these two categories.

Step 3: The premise "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States" tells us that if someone is a US citizen, they can register to vote.

Step 4: The premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election" states that anyone who can register to vote in the US is eligible to participate in the election.

Step 5: The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" presents two possibilities for Ekaterina.

Step 6: We are given that Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is a manager at Gazprom. This does not directly tell us anything about his citizenship or whether he is a Russian Federation official.

Step 7:  Since the premises do not provide enough information to definitively determine if Vladimir is a Russian Federation official, the statement "Vladimir is not a Russian federation official" remains uncertain.

Step 1:  From the premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election," we know that if Ekaterina can register to vote in the US, she can participate in the election.
Step 2:  From the premise "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States," we know that if Ekaterina is a US citizen, she can register to vote.
Step 3: The premise "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship" tells us Ekaterina must fit into one of these categories.
Step 4: The premises about Vladimir and Russian Federation officials are irrelevant to Ekaterina's situation.
Step 5: The premise "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official" gives us two possibilities:
    -  Ekaterina can register to vote in the US.
    -  Ekaterina is a Russian federation official.
Step 6:  If Ekaterina can register to vote in the US (from Step 1 and 2), she can participate in the election.
Step 7:  If Ekaterina is a Russian federation official, she is not a US citizen (from Step 3 and the fact that no Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship). 
Step 8: Therefore, Ekaterina can either participate in the 2024 US presidential election or is a Russian federation official.

Step 1: We know from the premise "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States." that if someone is a US citizen, they can register to vote.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election." that if someone can register to vote in the US, they can participate in the election.
Step 3: Combining these, we can conclude that if someone has US citizenship, they can participate in the 2024 US presidential election.
Step 4: The premise "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship" tells us that everyone falls into one of these two categories.
Step 5: We are given that "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship."
Step 6: We also know "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom." This means Vladimir must be a US citizen (from step 4).
Step 7: Therefore, since Vladimir is a US citizen (step 6), he can participate in the 2024 US presidential election (step 3).
Step 8: The premise states "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official." This means Ekaterina either can register to vote in the US or is a Russian federation official.
Step 9: Since Vladimir is not a Russian federation official (step 6), Ekaterina cannot be a Russian federation official (step 8).
Step 10: Therefore, Ekaterina must be able to register to vote in the US (step 8).
Step 11:  And since Ekaterina can register to vote in the US, she can participate in the 2024 US presidential election (step 2).
Step 12:  Thus, we have confirmed that both Ekaterina and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 US presidential election.
Step 13:  The conclusion states "Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election or Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom." This is true because we know both can participate in the election.

Step 1:  We know from the premise "Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election" that if someone can register to vote in the US, they can also participate in the election.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States."
Step 3:  Combining these, we can deduce that if someone has US citizenship, they can participate in the 2024 US presidential election.
Step 4: The premise states "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship."
Step 5: We are also given "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship" and "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom." This tells us that Vladimir does not hold Taiwanese citizenship.
Step 6:  Therefore, Vladimir must have US citizenship (from step 4).
Step 7:  Since Vladimir has US citizenship, he can participate in the 2024 US presidential election (from step 3).
Step 8: The premise states "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official."
Step 9: We know Vladimir is not a Russian federation official (from step 5).
Step 10: Therefore, Ekaterina must be able to register to vote in the United States.
Step 11:  Since Ekaterina can register to vote in the US, she can also participate in the 2024 US presidential election (from step 1).
Step 12:  We have established that both Ekaterina and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 US presidential election.
Step 13:  Therefore, the statement "It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election" is false.

Step 3:  The premise states "Neapolitan Chronicles was translated from Italian" and "Neapolitan Chronicles is a book published by New Vessel Press."
Step 4: This tells us that New Vessel Press publishes translated books, specifically Italian literature.
Step 5: There is no mention of Harry Potter being a translated work or being published by New Vessel Press.
Step 6: Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether or not Harry Potter was published by New Vessel Press based on the given information.

Step 1: We know from the premise that New Vessel Press specializes in translating foreign literature into English.
Step 2:  We also know that all books published by New Vessel Press are in English.
Step 3:  This implies that every book published by New Vessel Press is a translation.
Step 4:  We are given that Neapolitan Chronicles is a book published by New Vessel Press and it was translated from Italian.
Step 5:  Since all books published by New Vessel Press are translations, and Neapolitan Chronicles is one of them, we can conclude that Palace of Flies, also published by New Vessel Press, must be a translation as well.
Step 6: However, the premises do not specify the original language of Palace of Flies. 
Step 7:  Therefore, while we know Palace of Flies is a translation, we don't know for sure if it was translated from Italian.
Step 8: The statement "Palace of Flies was translated from Italian" is not definitively true based on the given information.

Step 1: We know from the premise "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds" and "All alkanes are hydrocarbons" that all alkanes are organic compounds.
Step 2: We also know from the premise "All organic compounds are chemical compounds" that all organic compounds are chemical compounds.
Step 3: Combining these, we can deduce that all alkanes are chemical compounds.
Step 4: The premise states "All organic compounds contain carbon" and since all alkanes are organic compounds, we can conclude that all alkanes contain carbon.
Step 5: The premise "No chemical compounds contain only one element" tells us that a chemical compound must contain at least two different elements.
Step 6: The mixture is either a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither.  Since we know all alkanes are chemical compounds and contain carbon, and the mixture is either a chemical compound or not, if the mixture is a chemical compound, it must contain at least two elements, and therefore must contain carbon.
Step 7:  Therefore, if the mixture is a chemical compound, it must contain carbon.
Step 8:  We don't know for sure if the mixture is a chemical compound or not, but if it is, it must contain carbon.
Step 9:  Thus, the statement "The mixture contains carbon" is true if the mixture is a chemical compound, and uncertain if it is not.

Step 1: From the premise "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds" and "All alkanes are hydrocarbons," we can deduce that all alkanes are organic compounds.
Step 2: From the premise "All organic compounds are chemical compounds," we can deduce that all organic compounds are chemical compounds.
Step 3: From the premise "All organic compounds contain carbon," we can deduce that all organic compounds contain carbon.
Step 4: From the premise "No chemical compounds contain only one element," we can deduce that if something is a chemical compound, it must contain at least two elements.
Step 5: The premise "The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither" presents a disjunction. This means it must be either true that the mixture is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or it must be false that the mixture is a chemical compound and contains only one element.
Step 6: Since we know from steps 2-3 that all organic compounds are chemical compounds and contain carbon, and we also know from step 4 that chemical compounds must contain at least two elements, the mixture cannot be a chemical compound and contain only one element.
Step 7: Therefore, the disjunction in step 5 must be false, meaning the mixture is not a chemical compound and does not contain only one element.
Step 8: Since the mixture is not a chemical compound and does not contain only one element, it cannot be an alkane (which is a type of hydrocarbon, and thus a chemical compound).
Step 9: Therefore, the statement "The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon" is false.

Step 1: We know from the premises that "All hydrocarbons are organic compounds" and "All alkanes are hydrocarbons". Therefore, we can conclude that all alkanes are organic compounds.
Step 2: We also know "All organic compounds are chemical compounds" and "All organic compounds contain carbon".
Step 3: Combining these facts, we can say that all alkanes are chemical compounds and contain carbon.
Step 4: The premise states "No chemical compounds contain only one element".
Step 5: The conclusion claims "If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane." 
Step 6: Since we know alkanes are chemical compounds and contain carbon, the conclusion is true. If a mixture contains only one element, it cannot be a chemical compound. If a mixture contains carbon, it is not necessarily a chemical compound (as it could contain other elements as well).
Step 7: Therefore, if the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, it cannot be a chemical compound or an alkane.

Step 2: The premise also tells us "All Greeks are humans." This means that every individual who is Greek is also a human.

Step 3: Since all Greeks are humans, and all humans are mortal, it logically follows that all Greeks must also be mortal.

Step 4:  The conclusion states "Some Greeks are mortal."  Because we know *all* Greeks are mortal (from our derivation in Step 3), the statement "some Greeks are mortal" is true.

    P: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often
    A: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events
    S: Bonnie is a student who attends the school
    I: Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community
    C: Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career
Premises:
    If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she attends and is very engaged with school events. (P → A)
    People in the club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members. (P ∨ I)
    People in the club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school. (¬S ∧ C → ¬S)
    All people in the club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. (I → C)
    All young children and teenagers in the club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. (C ∧ Y → S)
    Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school. (A ∧ S) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬S)

Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know that if Bonnie is in the club and is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career, then she must be a student who attends the school.
    From (4), if Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community, then she must chaperone high school dances, and from (3), we know that chaperones are not students.
    Therefore, Bonnie cannot be both inactive and disinterested in the community and a student who attends the school.
    This leaves us with the possibility that Bonnie either performs in school talent shows often (P) and is both attending and engaged with school events (A) and a student (S), or she is not performing in school talent shows often (¬P) and is neither attending and engaged nor a student.
    The premise (6) states that Bonnie is in the club and must be in one of these two states.

1 out of 1 is correct!
Let:
    C: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events
    S: Bonnie is a student who attends the school
    I: Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community
    Y: Bonnie is a young child or teenager
    E: Bonnie wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities
    D: Bonnie chaperones high school dances
Premises:

    C ∨ (I ∧ ¬C)
    D → ¬S
    I ∧ ¬C → D
    Y ∧ E ∧ S
    C ∨ (¬C ∧ ¬S)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know C ∨ (¬C ∧ ¬S) must be true. This means either C is True or (¬C ∧ ¬S) is True.
    Let's analyze each possibility:
    * **Case 1: C is True**
        * From (1), if C is True, then S ∨ I must be True.
        * This means either S is True or I is True.
    * **Case 2: (¬C ∧ ¬S) is True**
        * From (4), if I ∧ ¬C is True, then D must be True.
        * From (3), if D is True, then ¬S must be True.
    * In both cases, we see that if C is True or (¬C ∧ ¬S) is True, then either S or I must be True.

    I: Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community
Premises:
    People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events. (T → A)
    People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members. (T ∨ I)

Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know either (A ∧ S) or (¬A ∧ ¬S) must be true.
    Let's analyze each possibility:
    * **Case 1: (A ∧ S) is True**
        * From (1), if T is True then A is True, and since A is True, T must be True.
        * From (2), if T is True then I is False.
        * From (3), if C is True then S is False, so C must be False.
        * From (4), if I is True then C is True, so I must be False.
        * Therefore, in this case, Bonnie is a student who attends the school and performs in school talent shows often, and is neither a chaperone nor inactive and disinterested.
    * **Case 2: (¬A ∧ ¬S) is True**
        * From (2), if T is True then I is False, and since A is False, T must be False.
        * From (4), if I is True then C is True, so I must be True.
        * From (3), if C is True then S is False, so S must be False.
        * Therefore, in this case, Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, does not perform in school talent shows often, and is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

    M: James is a manager
    R: James is working remotely from home

Premises:

    B ↔ M
Logical Chain:
    From (7), if B is True, then M must be True.
    From (6), if M is True, then R is False.
    Therefore, if B is True, then R must be False.
    From (2), if C is True, then E must be True.
    From (1), if E is True, then B must be True.
    Therefore, if C is True, then B must be True.
    From (4), if H is True, then R is True.
    From (5), if O is True, then R is True.
    From (6), if M is True, then R is False.
    Therefore, if C is True, then H and O must be False.
    Thus, the only possible scenario where C is True is when B is True.

2 out of 4 is correct!
Let:
    M: James is a manager
    C: James has lunch in the company building
    R: James works remotely from home
    O: James is in another country
Premises:
    If James schedules a meeting with their customers, he will go to the company building today. (This implies that if James has lunch in the company building, he schedules meetings with customers)
    Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
    Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
    If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
    All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
    No managers work remotely from home.
    James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager. (This implies that if James is in the company building today, he is a manager)
Logical Chain:
    From (7), if James is in the company building today, then he is a manager (M = True).
    From (6), if James is a manager, then he does not work remotely from home (R = False).
    From (5), if James is in another country, then he works remotely from home (O → R).
    From (4), if James has lunch at home, then he works remotely from home (C → R).
    From (3), James has lunch either in the company building or at home (C ∨ ¬C).
    We need to analyze the possibilities:
    * If C is True (James has lunch in the company building), then from (1) and (2) we know he schedules meetings with customers. This would lead to M = True, and from (6), R = False.
    * If ¬C is True (James has lunch at home), then from (4) we know R = True.
    * From (5), if James is in another country, then O = True and R = True.
    * From (7), if James is in the company building today, then M = True.
    Therefore, the only way James can be in the company building today is if he has lunch in the company building and is a manager.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| M (Manager) | C (Lunch in company) | R (Remote work) | O (In another country) |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| True          | True                  | False             | False                |
| True          | False                 | True               | False                |

2 out of 5 is correct!
Let:
    M: James is a manager
    O: James is in other countries
    H: James has lunch at home
    R: James works remotely from home
Premises:
    If James schedules a meeting with their customers, then James will go to the company building today. (This premise does not directly relate to lunch or remote work)
    Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. (This premise does not directly relate to lunch or remote work)
    Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home. (This premise is relevant)
    If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home. (This premise is relevant)
    All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. (This premise is relevant)
    No managers work remotely from home. (This premise is relevant)
    James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager. (This premise is relevant)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), if M = True then R = False.
    From (5), if O = True then R = True.
    From (3), H ∨ ¬H must be True (lunch is either at home or not).
    From (4), if H = True then R = True.
    From (7), if James is in the company today, then M = True.
    Therefore, we can deduce a chain of implications:
    - If O = True, then R = True.
    - If M = True, then R = False.
    - If H = True, then R = True.
    - If H = False, then R = False.

    S: The being has fever
    H_M: The being has headache
    MP: The being has muscle pains
    T: The being is tired
    Flu: The being has the flu
Premises:
    M → F
    M can occur in certain animals
    H is True (Humans are mammals)
    M ∨ H
    S ∧ H_M ∧ MP ∧ T are symptoms of Monkeypox
    T ∧ Flu
Logical Chain:
    From (2), we know that M can occur in certain animals, so A must be True at least once.

Premises:
    M → F (If the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox)
    M can occur in certain animals.
    H is True (Humans are mammals)
    A is True (Mammals are animals)
    S has symptoms of Monkeypox (Fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness)
    People feel tired when they get the flu.
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    ¬∃S (No one gets the flu)
Logical Chain:
    The premises do not state that no one gets the flu. 
    In fact, the premises state that the Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, and humans are animals. 
    While the premises list symptoms of Monkeypox, they do not state that these are the only symptoms of any illness.

    O: Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey
Premises:
    There are six types of wild turkeys: Eastern wild turkey, Osceola wild turkey, Gould’s wild turkey, Merriam’s wild turkey, Rio Grande wild turkey, and Ocellated wild turkey. (This premise is for context, not directly used for the conclusion)
    Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey. (¬E)
    Tom is not an Osceola wild turkey. (¬O)
    Tom is not a Gould's wild turkey. (¬G)
    Tom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey. (¬M ∧ ¬R)
    Tom is a wild turkey. (E ∨ O ∨ G ∨ M ∨ R ∨ O)
Logical Chain:
    From (1), (2), (3), and (4), we can deduce that Tom cannot be any of the five listed wild turkeys.
    From (5), we know Tom must be one of the six wild turkeys.
    Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey (O).

    Tom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey (¬M ∧ ¬R)
    Tom is a wild turkey (E ∨ O ∨ G ∨ M ∨ R ∨ O)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Joey is a wild turkey (J)
Logical Chain:
    From (2), ¬E = True
    From (3), ¬O = True
    From (4), ¬G = True
    From (5), ¬M ∧ ¬R = True, so ¬M = True and ¬R = True
    From (6), E ∨ O ∨ G ∨ M ∨ R ∨ O must be True. Since E, O, G, M, and R are all False, O must be True.
    Therefore, Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey (O = True).

Let:
    R: Rockie is a rabbit
    T: Rockie is a turtle
    S: Rockie is a squirrel
    C: Rockie is cute
    Sk: Rockie is skittish
    Ca: Rockie is calm
Premises:
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (Sk → ¬Ca)
    All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. (If R ∧ Spotted, then C)
    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (R ∨ S)
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (If S ∧ Spotted, then Sk)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (Spotted ∧ Ca)
Logical Chain:
    From (5) and (6), if Rockie is spotted, then Rockie must be a squirrel (S) because the only animals spotted are rabbits and squirrels.
    From (4) and (5), if Rockie is a squirrel, then Rockie is skittish (Sk).
    From (1), if Rockie is skittish, then Rockie is not calm (¬Ca).
    This contradicts the fact that Rockie is calm (Ca), so Rockie cannot be a squirrel.
    Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit.
Truth Table (for Rockie):
| R (Rabbit) | T (Turtle) | S (Squirrel) | C (Cute) | Sk (Skittish) | Ca (Calm) |

Let:
    R: Rockie is a rabbit
    S: Rockie is a squirrel
    T: Rockie is a turtle
    C: Rockie is calm
    Sk: Rockie is skittish
Premises:
    All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. (R → C)
    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. (∃T)
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (R ∨ S)
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (Sk → ¬C)
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (S → Sk)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (R ∨ S) ∧ C
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know R ∨ S = True and C = True.
    From (5), if S were True, then Sk would be True, and from (4), if Sk were True, then C would be False, contradicting (6).
    Therefore, S must be False.
    Since S is False and R ∨ S = True, R must be True.
    From (1), if R is True, then C is True.
    From (2), we know T is possible, but we don't have enough information to conclude that Rockie is a turtle.

    S: Rockie is a squirrel
    T: Rockie is a turtle
    C: Rockie is cute
    B: Rockie is skittish
    P: Rockie can be spotted near the campus
Premises:
    All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. (If P ∧ R, then C)
    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. (∃x(P ∧ T))
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (P → (R ∨ S))
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (B → ¬C)
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (P ∧ S → B)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (P ∧ ¬B)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), P = True.
    From (5) and (6), since P is True and B is False, S must be False.
    From (3), since P is True and S is False, R must be True.
    From (1), since P ∧ R is True, C must be True.

Let:
    R: Rockie is a rabbit
    T: Rockie is a turtle
    S: Rockie is a squirrel
    C: Rockie is cute
    K: Rockie is skittish
Premises:
    If Rockie is a rabbit, then Rockie is cute (R → C)
    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (R ∨ S)
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (K → ¬C)
    All squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (S → K)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (R ∨ S ∧ ¬K)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    ¬(T ∧ S) → (C ∨ K)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know R ∨ S ∧ ¬K is True.
    From (5), if S were True, then K would be True, which contradicts ¬K in (6).
    Therefore, S must be False.
    From (3), if R ∨ S is True and S is False, then R must be True.
    From (1), if R is True, then C is True.
    From (2), we know T is uncertain.
    Therefore, ¬(T ∧ S) is True (since S is False).
    From (1) and (6), we know C is True.
    Thus, (C ∨ K) is True.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):

Let:
    R: Rockie is a rabbit
    T: Rockie is a turtle
    C: Rockie is cute
    S: Rockie is skittish
    V: Rockie is a squirrel
Premises:
    All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. (If R ∧ S, then C)
    Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. (Some T)
    The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. (R ∨ S ∨ T)
    If something is skittish, then it is not calm. (S → ¬C)
    All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. (If V, then S)
    Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm. (R ∨ S ∨ T ∧ C)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle, which translates to C ∧ C → (T ∧ S)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), if Rockie is a squirrel, then Rockie is skittish (S = True).
    From (6), Rockie is calm (C = True).
    From (4), if Rockie is skittish, then Rockie is not calm (S → ¬C), which contradicts the fact that Rockie is calm.
    Therefore, Rockie cannot be a squirrel.
    From (3), the only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits, squirrels, or turtles. Since Rockie is not a squirrel, Rockie must be either a rabbit or a turtle.
    From (1), if Rockie is a rabbit and cute, then Rockie is a rabbit (R ∧ C).
    From (2), some turtles can be spotted near the campus, so Rockie could be a turtle.
    However, we cannot definitively conclude that Rockie is a skittish turtle (T ∧ S) based on the given information.

    If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien. (M → A)
    No extraterrestrials are human (E → ¬H)
    All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans. (E ∧ I → H)

    Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither. (E ∧ M) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬M)
    If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial. (¬E → A)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), I = True.
    From (4), if E is True and I is True, then H must also be True.
    From (6), we have two possibilities:
        * E ∧ M is True: This means Marvin is from both Earth and Mars, which is a contradiction.
        * ¬E ∧ ¬M is True: This means Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars.
    From (7), if ¬E is True, then A must be True.
    Therefore, if Marvin is not from Mars (¬M), and he is not from Earth (¬E), then he is an alien (A).
    From (2), if Marvin is an alien (A), then he is an extraterrestrial (E).
    From (3), if Marvin is an extraterrestrial (E), then he is not a human (¬H).

    We need to analyze each possibility:
    * **Case 1: G is True**
        * From (2), if G is True, then P is True.
        * From (4), if P is True, then A is True.
        * From (6), if A is True, then F is True.
        * From (7), if F is True, then W is True.
        * From (8), if F is True, then W is True.
        * From (7), if W is True, then T is True.
        * Therefore, if G is True, we have the chain: G → P → A → F → W → T.
    * **Case 2: O is True**
        * From (3), if O is True, then C is True.
        * From (5), if C is True, then W is True.
        * From (7), if W is True, then T is True.

Let:
    D: Djokovic is at the mixer
    C: Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion
    A: Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor
    P: Djokovic is a professional tennis player
    E: Djokovic is a celebrity
    F: Djokovic is famous
    W: Djokovic is well-paid
    T: Djokovic lives in a tax haven
Premises:
    D is True (given)
    C ∨ A (Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor)
    If C is True, then P is True (C → P)
    If A is True, then E is True (A → E)
    If E is True, then W is True (E → W)
    If W is True, then T is True (W → T)
    P → F (If Djokovic is a professional tennis player, then Djokovic is famous)
    If F is True, then W is True (F → W)
Logical Chain:

    From (1), D = True.
    From (2), we know either C or A must be True.
    We need to analyze each possibility:
    * **Case 1: C is True**
        * From (2), C = True.
        * From (3), if C is True, then P is True (C → P)
        * From (4), if P is True, then F is True (P → F)
        * From (5), if F is True, then W is True (F → W)
        * From (6), if W is True, then T is True (W → T)
        * Therefore, in this case, T = True.
    * **Case 2: A is True**
        * From (2), A = True.
        * From (4), if A is True, then E is True (A → E)
        * From (5), if E is True, then W is True (E → W)
        * From (6), if W is True, then T is True (W → T)
        * Therefore, in this case, T = True.

    All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens. (W → T)
    Djokovic is at the mixer. (D is True)
    If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid. (F → W)

Logical Chain:

    From (8), D = True.
    We need to analyze the possible combinations of G, O, P, C, A, F, W, and T based on the premises.
    The most relevant path is:
    *  D = True (Given)
    *  From (1), D = True implies G ∨ O must be True.
    *  Let's assume G is True.
    *  From (2), G = True implies P = True.
    *  From (4), P = True implies A = True.
    *  From (6), A = True implies F = True.
    *  From (7), W = True.
    *  From (7), W = True implies T = True.

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):

Let:
    Z: Design by Max is Zaha Hadid's design style
    K: Design by Max is Kelly Wearstler's design style
    I: Design has interesting geometries
    B: Design is a brutalist building
    E: Design is evocative
    D: Design is dreamy
Premises:
    If Z and I, then B and E (Z ∧ I → B ∧ E)
    ¬(B ∧ I)  (No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries)
    Z ∨ K (Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style)
    If K, then E and D (K → E ∧ D)
Logical Chain:

    From (2), we know ¬(B ∧ I). This means if a design by Max has interesting geometries, it cannot be brutalist. 
    From (1), we see that if a design by Max has interesting geometries, it must be both a brutalist building and evocative. 
    Therefore, the premises contradict each other and the conclusion cannot be true.

    K: The design is Kelly Wearstler's design style
    I: The design has interesting geometries
    B: The design is a brutalist building
    E: The design is evocative
    D: The design is dreamy
Premises:
    If Z ∧ (Max adores it), then I is True
    If K ∧ (Max adores it), then I is False
    Z ∨ K
    If Z ∧ (Max adores it) ∧ I, then B ∧ E
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if K ∧ (Max adores it), then I = False.
    From (1), if Z ∧ (Max adores it), then I = True.
    From (3), Z ∨ K must be True.
    Therefore, at least one of Z ∧ (Max adores it) or K ∧ (Max adores it) must be True.
    If Z ∧ (Max adores it) is True, then from (4), B ∧ E must also be True.
    If K ∧ (Max adores it) is True, then from (2), I = False.
    Since all of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are both evocative and dreamy (from (3)), if K ∧ (Max adores it) is True, then E ∧ D must be True.

Let:
    Z: Design is Zaha Hadid's design style
    K: Design is Kelly Wearstler's design style
    I: Design has interesting geometries
    B: Design is a brutalist building
    E: Design is evocative
    D: Design is dreamy
Premises:
    If Z and Max adores it, then I (Z → I)
    If K and Max adores it, then E ∧ D (K → E ∧ D)
    Z ∨ K (Max adores either Z or K)
    B ∧ I → E (If I and B, then E)
    ¬(B ∧ I) (No brutalist buildings with interesting geometries)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), ¬(B ∧ I) is True. This means if a design is both brutalist and has interesting geometries, Max cannot adore it.
    From (1), if Z is True (Zaha Hadid's design style) and Max adores it, then I (interesting geometries) must be True.
    From (2), if K is True (Kelly Wearstler's design style) and Max adores it, then E ∧ D (evocative and dreamy) must be True.
    From (3), Z ∨ K must be True, meaning either Z or K is True.
    Therefore, if Z is True, then I is True.
    Therefore, if K is True, then E ∧ D is True.
    In either case, the design must be either evocative or dreamy.

    M: Coco Gauff is male
    A: Coco Gauff is a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022
    G: Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand Slam players
Premises:
    If someone is ranked highly by the WTA, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. (R → G)
    Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA. (L → R)
    All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek. (F → L)

    All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal. (M → ¬G)
    If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. (R ∨ L → ¬A)
    Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022. (G is not explicitly stated)
Logical Chain:
    From (7), we know Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, so A is True.
    From (6), if R ∨ L were True, then A would be False. Since A is True, R ∨ L must be False.
    Therefore, both R and L must be False.
    From (2), if L were True, then R would be True. Since L is False, R must also be False.
    From (1), if R were True, then G would be True. Since R is False, G must be False.

    From (4), all players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
    Therefore, if Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, she must have lost to Iga Świątek.
    From (2), if Coco Gauff lost to Iga Świątek, then she is ranked highly by the WTA.
    From (1), if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA, then she is one of the most active players in major tennis.
    Therefore, if Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, she is both a player who lost to Iga Świątek and one of the most active players in major tennis.

Premises:
    All cats are mammals (C → M)
    Some pets are not mammals (¬M ∃P)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    ¬(P ∧ C) (No pets are cats)
Logical Chain:
    The premises do not state that *all* pets are not mammals, only that *some* are not.
    This means there could still be pets that are mammals.
    Since all cats are mammals (C → M), if something is a pet and a cat, it must also be a mammal.

    Emma's favorite season is summer.
    Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
    James wants to have a long vacation.
Logical Chain:
    From (3), E = True.
    From (4), M ≠ E, so M must be one of the other three seasons (S, W, or F).
    From (2), if someone wants a long vacation and has summer as their favorite season, then they are a student.

Premises:
    No digital media are analog. (D → ¬A)
    Every printed text is analog media. (P → A)
    All streaming services are digital media. (S → D)
    If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text. (If H, then P)
    If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book. (S → P)
Logical Chain:
    From (3), if S is True, then D is True.
    From (1), if D is True, then A is False.
    From (2), if P is True, then A is True.
    Therefore, if S is True, then P must be True.
    However, we don't know for sure if S is True or False.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| D (Digital) | A (Analog) | P (Printed Text) | S (Streaming Service) |

Let:
    S: 1984 is a streaming service
    P: 1984 is a printed text
    A: 1984 is analog
Premises:
    No digital media are analog. (All digital media are not analog)
    Every printed text is analog media.
    All streaming services are digital media.
    If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
    If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.
Logical Chain:
    From (3), if S is True, then A must be True.
    From (2), if P is True, then A must be True.
    From (5), if S is True, then P must be True.
    This creates a contradiction: S = True implies both A = True and A = False.
    Therefore, S must be False.

Let:
    S: 1984 is a streaming service
    H: 1984 is a hardcover book
    D: 1984 is digital media
    A: 1984 is analog media
Premises:
    No digital media are analog. (D → ¬A)
    Every printed text is analog media. (H → A)
    All streaming services are digital media. (S → D)
    If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text. (H → H)
    If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book. (S → H)
Logical Chain:
    We can use the premises to derive a contradiction if we assume 1984 is a streaming service (S = True):
    From (3), if S = True then D = True.
    From (1), if D = True then A = False.
    From (2), if H = True then A = True.
    From (5), if S = True then H = True.
    This creates a contradiction: A = False and A = True.
    Therefore, the assumption that 1984 is a streaming service (S = True) must be false.
Truth Table (for 1984):

Premises:
    All Romance languages are Indo-European languages (R → I)
    Romance languages are a language family.
    All languages within a language family are related to each other.
    French and Spanish are both Romance languages.
    German is related to Spanish.
    Basque is not related to any other language.
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    Basque is a Romance language, which translates to R.
Logical Chain:
    From (1), (2), (3), and (4), we know that if something is a Romance language, it is both Indo-European and related to other Romance languages.
    From (5), we know German is related to Spanish, and from (4), Spanish is a Romance language. Therefore, German is related to a Romance language.
    From (6), Basque is not related to any other language.
    Since Basque is not related to any other language, it cannot be a Romance language.

Let:
    P: A member of Pappy's has starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three.
Premises:
    Badults is a British Sitcom series starring members of Pappy's.
    Badults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three.
    The Working title "The Secret Dude Society" was used for Badults.
    Andrew Collins was the script editor for Badults.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    ¬P (No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three)
Logical Chain:
    The premises establish that Badults, starring members of Pappy's, was piloted on BBC Three. 
    This means at least one member of Pappy's has starred in a show piloting on BBC Three.
    Therefore, P = True.

    P: KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation
    R: KO is suitable for a retirement fund
Premises:
    All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. (G → P)
    If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. (P → ¬R)
    Some stocks are growth stocks. (There exists a stock that is a growth stock)
    All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. (M → R)
    KO is a mature stock. (M = True)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    KO is a stock, which is a general statement and not directly addressed by the premises.
Logical Chain:
    From (5), M = True.
    From (4), if M is True, then R is True.
    Therefore, KO is a suitable stock for a retirement fund (R = True).

Let:
    G: KO is a growth stock
    M: KO is a mature stock
    S: KO is a stock
Premises:
    All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
    If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
    Some stocks are growth stocks.
    All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
    KO is a mature stock.
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    KO is a stock and a growth stock, which translates to S ∧ G.
Logical Chain:
    From (5), M = True.
    From (4), if M were True, then KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
    From (2), if a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
    From (1), all growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.

51 out of 72 is correct!
Let:
    G: KO is a growth stock
    P: KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation
    M: KO is a mature stock
    S: KO is a stock
    V: KO's price is volatile
Premises:
    All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. (G → P)
    If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. (P → ¬M)
    Some stocks are growth stocks. (There exists a stock that is a growth stock)
    All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. (M → S)
    KO is a mature stock. (M = True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile, which translates to (G ∨ P) → (¬S ∧ ¬V)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), M = True.
    From (4), if M is True, then S = True.
    Therefore, S = True.
    From (1), if G is True, then P is True.
    From (2), if P is True, then M is False, which contradicts our earlier derivation of M = True.
    Therefore, G must be False.
    Since G is False, the conclusion (G ∨ P) → (¬S ∧ ¬V) is vacuously true. 
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| G (KO is a growth stock) | P (KO is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation) | M (KO is a mature stock) | S (KO is a stock) | V (KO's price is volatile) | (G ∨ P) → (¬S ∧ ¬V) |

    B34: Tom's license plate begins with the number 34
    B35: Tom's license plate begins with the number 35
Premises:
    All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34 (B34 → I)
    Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul (¬B34 → ¬I)
    Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul (Joe's plate is from Istanbul, but irrelevant to Tom)
    Tom's license plate begins with the number 35 (B35 is True)
    If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34 (B35 → ¬B34)
Logical chain:
    From (4), B35 = True.
    From (5), if B35 is True, then B34 must be False.
    From (2), if B34 is False, then I must be False.

    P: People at Mary's school are not picky eaters
    E: People at Mary's school spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls

Premises:
    S → T
    O → S
    O ∨ D
    D → P
    D → E
    H is True
    S ∧ ¬T → ¬P
Logical Chain:
    From (6), H = True.
    From (2), if O is True, then S is True.
    From (3), either O or D must be True.
    If O is True, then from (2) S is True, and from (1) T is True.
    If D is True, then from (4) P is True and from (5) E is True.
    From (7), if S is True and ¬T is True, then ¬P is True. This is a contradiction, so S and ¬T cannot both be True.
    Therefore, T must be True.

    M: Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition
    P: Hannah is a picky eater
    D: Hannah spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls
Premises:
    If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition. (S → M)
    If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus. (T → S)
    People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes. (T ∨ E)
    If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters. (E → ¬P)
    If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. (E → D)
    Hannah is at Mary's school. (H is True)
    Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. (S ∧ M → (¬P ∧ ¬M))
Logical Chain:
    From (6), H = True.
    From (1), if S = True, then M = True.
    From (7), if S ∧ M = True, then ¬P ∧ ¬M = True.
    Therefore, if S = True, then ¬P = True and ¬M = True.
    This contradicts the premise (1) that S → M.
    Therefore, S must be False.
    From (2), if T = True, then S = True.
    Since S is False, T must be False.
    From (3), if T is False, then E must be True.
    From (4), if E = True, then ¬P = True.
    From (5), if E = True, then D = True.

Let:
    B: Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa.
    S: Dried Thai chilies are spicy
    M: Dried Thai chilies are mala hotpots
    C: Dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets
Premises:
    ¬(B ∧ S)  (No baked sweets are spicy)
    All cupcakes are baked sweets (C → ¬B)
    All mala hotpots are spicy (M → S)
    All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes (B → C)
    Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets (S ∨ M ∨ C)
Logical Chain:

    From (5), we know S ∨ M ∨ C must be True.

    * **Case 1: If S is True (Spicy):**
        * From (1), if B were True, then S would be True, which contradicts (1). 
        * Therefore, B must be False in this case.

    * **Case 2: If M is True (Mala Hotpot):**
        * From (2), if C were True, then B would be False.
        * From (3), if M were True, then S would be True.
        * Therefore, B must be False in this case.

    * **Case 3: If C is True (Not Baked Sweets):**
        * From (4), if B were True, then C would be False.
        * Therefore, B must be False in this case.

    In all three cases, we find that B must be False.

Let:
    T: The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service.
    N: The Hamden Plaza Subway store receives many negative reviews.
    R: The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four.
    L: The Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents.
Premises:
    If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.
    All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
    Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
    The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service, which translates to (T ∧ N) → (R ∧ ¬T).
Logical Chain:
    From (4), if L is True, then R is True.
    From (5), if R is True, then T must be False (from premise 1).
    Therefore, if L is True, then R is True and T must be False.
    This means (T ∧ N) → (R ∧ ¬T) is True for the case where L is True.
    However, if L is False, then the conclusion is not necessarily true.

Let:
    R: The Hamden Plaza Subway store is listed in Yelp's recommendations.
    N: The Hamden Plaza Subway store has received many negative reviews.
    T: The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service.
    P: The Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents
Premises:
    If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews. (R → ¬N)
    All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations. (G > 4 → R)
    Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. (¬T ∧ N)
    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four. (P → G > 4)
    The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. (G > 4 ∨ P)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know either G > 4 is True or P is True (or both).
    * If G > 4 is True:
        * From (2), if G > 4 is True, then R is True.
        * From (1), if R is True, then ¬N is True.
        * Therefore, if G > 4 is True, then N is False.
    * If P is True:
        * From (4), if P is True, then G > 4 is True.
        * From (2), if G > 4 is True, then R is True.
        * From (1), if R is True, then ¬N is True.
        * Therefore, if P is True, then N is False.
    In both cases, if either G > 4 or P is True, then N is False.
    Therefore, the Hamden Plaza Subway store does not receive many negative reviews.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| R (Yelp's Recommendations) | N (Many Negative Reviews) | T (Take-out Service) | P (Popular among Locals) | G > 4 (Rating > 4) |

Let:
    R: The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service.
    Y: The Hamden Plaza Subway store is listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
    N: The Hamden Plaza Subway store has received many negative reviews.
    P: The Hamden Plaza Subway store is popular among local residents
    G: The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four.
Premises:
    If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews. (Y → ¬N)
    All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations. (G → Y)
    Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. (¬R ∧ N)
    All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four. (P → G)
    The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents. (G ∨ P)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    The Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service, which translates to ¬R.
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know either G is True or P is True.
    Let's analyze each possibility:
    * **If G is True:**
        * From (2), if G is True, then Y is True.
        * From (1), if Y is True, then ¬N is True.
        * Therefore, if G is True, then the Hamden Plaza store is listed in Yelp's recommendations and has not received many negative reviews, which doesn't force R to be False.
    * **If P is True:**
        * From (4), if P is True, then G is True.
        * The analysis for G = True applies here as well.

    F: Sir Digby fights his nemesis
    W: Sir Digby wins
    L: Sir Digby’s nemesis wins
    N_in_movie: Sir Digby’s nemesis is in the movie
Premises:
    In superhero movies, the good guys always win. (If S is True, then G is True)
    The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is a superhero movie. (S = True)
    Good guys fight bad guys and vice versa. (If G is True, then N is False)
    Sir Digby fights his nemesis. (F is True)
    If a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is a good guy. (S → G)
    The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar is named after Sir Digby. (S → G)
    If somebody wins a fight, the person they are fighting does not win. (W → ¬L)
    If a superhero movie is named after a character, that character is in the movie. (S → N_in_movie)

    When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. (This premise implies that if someone reads a book, they gain knowledge.)
    If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Harry is smarter than before, which can be represented as S.

Let:
    K: A person gains knowledge
    S: A person is smarter
Premises:
    Books contain tons of knowledge. (This premise does not directly link to whether a person gains knowledge from reading.)
    When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. (This translates to: If a person reads a book, then they gain knowledge, or R → K)
    If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter. (This translates to: K → S)
    Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau. (This tells us Harry read a book, but doesn't guarantee knowledge gain.)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    A smarter person has gained knowledge, which translates to S → K.
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if Harry read a book, then he gained knowledge (R → K).
    From (3), if a person gains knowledge, they become smarter (K → S).
    Therefore, if Harry read a book, he gained knowledge, and if he gained knowledge, he became smarter. This does not mean *all* smarter people have gained knowledge, just that in this specific case, if Harry is smarter, it's because he gained knowledge.

    P: Pets are allowed in The Olive Garden
    D: The security deposit at The Olive Garden is no more than $1500
    F: Fluffy is Tom's cat
    C: Cats are pets
    M: A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building
    R: The monthly rent at The Olive Garden is $2000
    
Premises:
    Pets are allowed in some managed buildings. (P is True, but not necessarily at The Olive Garden)
    A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building. (M is True)
    The security deposit can be equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more. (This premise does not directly tell us anything about The Olive Garden)
    Fluffy is Tom's cat. (F is True)
    Cats are pets. (C is True)
    The Olive Garden is a managed building. (This is our focus building)
    The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000. (R = $2000)
    $2000 is more than $1500. (This is used for the deposit condition)
    Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500. (This is our key conditional statement)
    If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. (This is a general rule)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know The Olive Garden is a managed building.
    From (1), we know pets are allowed in some managed buildings, but not necessarily The Olive Garden.
    From (7), we know the monthly rent at The Olive Garden is $2000.
    From (8), we know $2000 is more than $1500.
    Therefore, the security deposit at The Olive Garden must be at least $2000.
    From (9), Tom will only rent if the security deposit is no more than $1500.
    Since the security deposit is at least $2000, Tom will not rent at The Olive Garden.

Premises:
    Pets are allowed in some managed buildings (P is True, but not necessarily in all)
    A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
    The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more. (S ∨ M)
    Fluffy is Tom's cat.
    Cats are pets.
    The Olive Garden is a managed building.
    The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
    $2000 is more than $1500.
    Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500. (P ∧ (F ∧ (S ∨ M) ∧ (D ≤ $1500)) → T)
    If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. (P → (T ∧ F))
Logical Chain:
    From (6), O = True
    From (7), R = $2000
    From (8), $2000 > $1500, so M = True
    From (9), if P is True, then T = True and F = True.

    From (7), the monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
    Therefore, the security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| M (Pets allowed in Olive Garden) | D (Security deposit $2000 or more) |

Let:
    H: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity
    C: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a company
    P: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company
    L: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law
    O: The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations.
Premises:
    All business organizations are legal entities. (B → H)
    All companies are business organizations. (C → B)
    All private companies are companies. (P → C)
    All legal entities are created under law. (H → L)
    All legal entities have legal obligations. (H → O)
    If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. (L → ¬P)
Logical Chain:
    From (1) and (2), if C is True, then H is True.
    From (3), if P is True, then C is True.
    From (4), if H is True, then L is True.
    From (5), if H is True, then O is True.
    From (6), if L is True, then ¬P must be True.
    Therefore, the Harvard Weekly Book Club must be a legal entity (H) and have legal obligations (O).

Let:
    H: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company
    L: The Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law
    O: The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations
Premises:
    All business organizations are legal entities. (B ⊆ L)
    All companies are business organizations. (C ⊆ B)
    All private companies are companies. (P ⊆ C)
    All legal entities are created under law. (L ⊆ C)
    All legal entities have legal obligations. (L → O)
    If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. (L → ¬P)
Logical Chain:
    We need to evaluate the truth of H → (O ∨ L).
    Assume H is True (Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company).
    From (3), if H is True, then P is True.
    From (4), if P is True, then C is True.
    From (2), if C is True, then B is True.
    From (1), if B is True, then L is True.
    From (5), if L is True, then O is True.
    Therefore, in all cases where H is True, O must also be True.

Let:
    A: Harry is an animal

    V: Harry is a vertebrate
    B: Harry is a bee
    Q: Harry is a queen bee
Premises:
    All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates (A → (I ∨ V))
    All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. (V → M)
    All vertebrate animals have a backbone. (V → B)
    All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. (B → ¬M)
    All queen bees are bees (Q → B)
    Harry is a bee (B is True)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), B = True.
    From (4), if B were True, then M would be False.
    From (3), if V were True, then B would be True.
    From (2), if V were True, then M would be True.
    Therefore, V must be False.
    From (1), if A is True, then either I or V must be True; since V is False, I must be True.
    From (5), if Q is True, then B is True; since B is True, Q could be True.

Let:
    B: Harry is a bee
    V: Harry is a vertebrate
    I: Harry is an invertebrate
    M: Harry reproduces by male-and-female mating
Premises:
    All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates (I ∨ V)
    All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating (V → M)
    All vertebrate animals have a backbone (V → B)
    All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating (B → ¬M)
    All queen bees are bees (If something is a queen bee, it is also a bee)
    Harry is a bee (B is True)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), B = True.
    From (4), if B is True, then ¬M must be True.
    From (2), if V were True, then M would be True; therefore, V must be False.
    From (1), since V is False, I must be True.
Truth Table (for Harry):
| B (Harry is a bee) | V (Harry is a vertebrate) | I (Harry is an invertebrate) | M (Harry reproduces by male-and-female mating) |

Let:
    V: Harry is a vertebrate
    B: Harry has a backbone
    I: Harry is an invertebrate
    Q: Harry is a queen bee
Premises:
    All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. (I ∨ V)
    All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. (B → ¬Q)
    All vertebrate animals have a backbone. (V → B)
    All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. (B ∧ Q)
    All queen bees are bees. (Q → B)
    Harry is a bee. (H is True)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), H = True
    From (5), if Q = True, then B = True
    From (4), if B = True, then Q = True
    Therefore, if H is a bee, then Q must be True.
    From (2), if B = True, then ¬Q = True.
    This creates a contradiction, so B must be False.
    From (3), if V = True, then B = True; since B is False, V must be False.
    From (1), if I ∨ V = True and V is False, then I must be True.
    Therefore, Harry is an invertebrate.
    The conclusion states "If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee."
    Since Harry is an invertebrate and not a queen bee, the conclusion holds true.

Let:
    M: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth

    A: Luke complains often about annoying siblings
    H: Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings

Premises:
    M ∧ E → H
    S → M
    A → S
    L → ¬E
    H → L
    M ∨ ¬M
Logical Chain:
    From (6), either M is True or ¬M is True.

    * **Case 1: M = True**
        * From (1), if M is True and E is True, then H is True.
        * From (4), if L is True, then E is False.
        * From (5), if H is True, then L is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, if M is True, we have a contradiction (E cannot be both True and False).
        * Therefore, M must be False.

    * **Case 2: ¬M = True**
        * From (6), ¬M is True.
        * From (2), if S is True, then M is True; since ¬M is True, S must be False.
        * From (3), if A is True, then S is True; since S is False, A must be False.
        * From (4), if L is True, then E is False.
        * From (5), if H is True, then L is True.
        * Therefore, in this case, we can have H = True if L is True.

Let:
    M: Luke is a baby born in a multiple birth
    S: Luke has siblings who were born together
    A: Luke complains often about annoying siblings
    H: Luke lives at home
    E: Luke lives with strangers
Premises:
    If people are born in a multiple birth with siblings, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings. (M ∧ S → H)
    If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth. (S → M)
    If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together. (A → S)
    If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers. (H → ¬E)
    If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. (H → A)
    Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. (M ∧ E) ∨ (¬M ∧ ¬E)

Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know either M ∧ E or ¬M ∧ ¬E is true.
    Let's analyze each possibility:
    * **Possibility 1:** M ∧ E (Born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers)
        * From (1), if M ∧ S were true, then H would be true.
        * From (2), if S were true, then M would be true.
        * From (4), if H were true, then E would be false.
        * This creates a contradiction, so M ∧ E cannot be true.
    * **Possibility 2:** ¬M ∧ ¬E (Not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers)
        * From (5), if H were true, then A would be true.
        * From (4), if H were true, then E would be false.
        * This creates a contradiction, so ¬M ∧ ¬E cannot be true.
    * **Therefore, neither possibility is true.**

Logical Chain:
    From (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), we can deduce that Tom can prove economic hardship and is applying for the GRE test.
    Therefore, Tom could potentially receive financial aid.

    All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. (This premise is irrelevant to the conclusion)
    If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy. (C → N)
    If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly. (O → C)
    All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness. (This premise is irrelevant to the conclusion)
    Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly. (S ∧ C) ∨ (¬S ∧ ¬C)

Conclusion to Evaluate:
    F ∨ O (Peter is either a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or he is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness)
Logical Chain:
    We can break down Peter's state into two possibilities based on the sixth premise:
    * **Case 1:** S ∧ C (Peter spills a lot and is cleanly)
        * From (1), if S is True, then ¬T must be True.
        * From (3), if C is True, then T must be True.
        * This creates a contradiction, so Case 1 is not possible.
    * **Case 2:** ¬S ∧ ¬C (Peter does not spill a lot and is not cleanly)
        * From (2), if S is False, then F must be False.
        * From (4), if ¬C is True, then ¬V must be True.
        * From (5), if ¬V is True, then ¬O must be True.
        * Therefore, in Case 2, O is False.
    * Since Case 1 is not possible, the only remaining possibility is Case 2 (¬S ∧ ¬C).
    * In Case 2, F is False and O is False.

        * From (2), if F is True, then S is True, so if Peter is a clumsy foodie, then he spills a lot.
        * From (3), if C is True, then T is True (Peter is notably tidy), which contradicts the previous point.
        * Therefore, if S is True, Peter cannot be a clumsy foodie and cleanly.
    * **Case 2: C is True**
        * From (3), if C is True, then T is True (Peter is notably tidy)
        * From (4), if O is True, then V is True (Peter's family values order and spotlessness)

    From (2), we know there exists at least one thing that is both a fir tree (F) and an object of worship (O).
    This does not mean *all* fir trees are objects of worship, nor does it mean *all* objects of worship are fir trees.
    Therefore, there could be evergreens that are not fir trees, and thus not objects of worship.

Premises:
    If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
    Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class. (M = True)
    If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z.
    Peter is a man who is taller than Michael. (P = True)
    Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
    Michael cannot block Windy's shooting. (This premise does not directly relate to Peter's height)
    Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter. (This premise does not directly relate to Peter's height)
Logical chain:
    From (2), M = True.
    From (4), P = True.
    Since Peter is taller than Michael, and Michael is taller than everyone else in his class, Peter must be taller than every man in Michael's class.

    If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters. (M → ¬O)
    All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers. (T → M)
    All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters. (S → O)
    All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. (This premise does not directly relate to John's car)
    If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. (¬T → ¬(T ∨ S))

Logical Chain:

*  From (2), if T is True, then M is True.
*  From (1), if M is True, then O is False.
*  Therefore, if T is True, then O is False.
*  From (4), if S is True, then O is True.

    If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. (¬T → ¬(T ∨ S))

Logical Chain:
    We need to determine if E is True.
    From (4), if E is True then S is True.

Let:
    M: Rock is a monkey
    B: Rock is a bird
    A: Rock is an animal
    F: Rock can fly
    W: Rock has wings
    C: Rock can breathe
Premises:
    All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals. (M → A)
    All monkeys are mammals. (M → M)
    Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. (M ∨ B)
    Peter's birds can fly. (B → F)
    All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe. (A → C)
    If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings. (F → W)
    Rock is Peter's pet. (Given, so M ∨ B ∨ ¬C is True)
    Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. (F ∨ B ∨ ¬C)
Logical Chain:

    From (7), we know M ∨ B ∨ ¬C is True.

    Let's analyze the possibilities:

    * **Case 1: Rock is a monkey (M = True):**
        * From (2), if M = True, then M → A is True, so A = True
        * From (5), if A = True, then A → C is True, so C = True
        * This case satisfies all premises.

    * **Case 2: Rock is a bird (B = True):**
        * From (3), if B = True, then B → F is True, so F = True
        * From (6), if F = True, then F → W is True, so W = True
        * This case satisfies all premises.

    * **Case 3: Rock is neither a monkey nor a bird (M = False and B = False):**
        * From (7), this means ¬C must be True.
        * This case violates (5), as it states that all animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.

    Therefore, Rock must be either a monkey or a bird. We cannot definitively determine if Rock is a monkey without further information.

| M (Rock is a monkey) | B (Rock is a bird) | A (Rock is an animal) | F (Rock can fly) | W (Rock has wings) | C (Rock can breathe) |

Let:
    M: Rock is a mammal
    B: Rock is a bird
    F: Rock can fly
    W: Rock has wings
    A: Rock is an animal

Premises:
    All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals. (M → A)
    All monkeys are mammals. (Monkeys are mammals)
    Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. (M ∨ B)
    Peter's birds can fly. (B → F)
    All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe. (A → C)
    If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings. (F → W)
    Rock is Peter's pet.
    Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. (F ∨ B ∨ ¬C)
Logical Chain:
    From (7), we know F ∨ B ∨ ¬C is True.
    We need to analyze each possibility:
    * **Case 1: F = True**
        * From (5), if A = True then C = True, and from (7) F = True, so C = True
        * From (6), if F = True then W = True
    * **Case 2: B = True**
        * From (3), if B = True then M = False (since M ∨ B is True)
        * From (2), if M = False then Rock is not a mammal.
        * From (1), if M = False then A is not guaranteed to be True.
        * Therefore, in this case, we cannot definitively say that Rock has wings.
    * **Case 3: ¬C = True**
        * From (5), if A = True then C = True, so A must be False.
        * From (1), if M = False then A is not guaranteed to be True.
        * Therefore, in this case, we cannot definitively say that Rock has wings.

Let:
    E: John is engaged
    F: John has a larger family
    W: John has a well-attended wedding
    P: John makes wedding plans
    I: John invites friends to their ceremony
Premises:
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬I ∧ ¬P)
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (I → P)
    All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged. (P → E)
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (I → P)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (W → I)
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (F → (W ∨ I))
Logical Chain:
    The premises establish a chain of conditional statements that link engagement, wedding plans, invitations, and family size.
    However, there is no direct path from the premises to the conclusion that John has a larger family (F).
    The premises only state that if John has a larger family, then he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.

    E: John is engaged
    W: John makes wedding plans
    I: John invites others to his ceremony
    F: John has a larger family
Premises:
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬I ∧ ¬W)
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (F → (W ∨ I))
    All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged. (W → E)
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (I → W)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (W → I)
Logical Chain:
    The premises create a complex web of interconnected conditions.  To determine if John does not have a larger family (¬F), we need to analyze all possible scenarios. 
    
    * **Scenario 1: John is engaged (E = True)**
        * From (1), if E is True, then ¬I ∧ ¬W must be True, meaning John does not invite others to his ceremony and does not make wedding plans.
        * This contradicts the premise that All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans (I → W).
        * Therefore, this scenario is not possible.

    * **Scenario 2: John is not engaged (E = False)**
        * From (3), if W is True, then E must be True. Since we know E is False, W must be False.
        * From (4), if I is True, then W must be True. Since we know W is False, I must be False.
        * Therefore, John does not make wedding plans and does not invite others to his ceremony.
        * From (5), if W is True, then I must be True. Since we know W is False, I is also False.
        * From (2), if F is True, then either W or I must be True. Since both W and I are False, F must be False.

Let:
    E: John is engaged
    P: John makes wedding plans
    I: John invites friends to their ceremony
    W: John has a well-attended wedding
    F: John has a larger family
Premises:
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬I ∧ ¬P)
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (I → P)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (W → I)
    Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families. (There exists a person with W ∧ F)
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (F → (W ∨ I))
Logical Chain:
    We cannot definitively conclude that John is engaged (E) from the given premises. 
    The premises provide information about the relationships between engagement, wedding plans, inviting friends, well-attended weddings, and larger families, but they do not state definitively that John is engaged.

Let:
    E: John is engaged
    W: John makes wedding plans
    I: John invites others to his ceremony
    F: John has a larger family
Premises:
    If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (E → ¬I ∧ ¬W)
    If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (F → (A ∨ I))
    All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. (I → W)
    All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged. (W → E)
    Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony. (A → I)
Logical Chain:
    We need to determine if ¬(F ∧ I) is true. 
    From (1), if E is True, then I and W are False.
    From (2), if F is True, then either A or I is True.
    From (3), if I is True, then W is True.
    From (4), if W is True, then E is True.
    Therefore, if John is engaged, then he cannot have a larger family and cannot invite others to his ceremony.
    If John has a larger family, then he either has a well-attended wedding or invites others to his ceremony.
    Thus, John cannot be both engaged and have a larger family.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| E (Engaged) | W (Makes wedding plans) | I (Invites others to ceremony) | F (Larger family) | ¬(F ∧ I) (Neither has a larger family nor invites others to his wedding) |

Let:
    M: Platypus is a mammal
    T: Platypus has teeth
Premises:
    Some mammals have teeth. (∃x(M(x) ∧ T(x)) is True)
    Platypuses have no teeth. (¬T(Platypus))
    Platypuses are mammals. (M(Platypus) is True)

    Platypuses have no teeth. (¬T(Platypus))
    Platypuses are mammals. (M(Platypus) is True)
    Humans have teeth. (T(Human) is True)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    Platypuses are reptiles, which translates to R(Platypus).
Logical Chain:
    From (2), ¬T(Platypus) is True.
    From (1), we know there exist mammals with teeth, but this doesn't force Platypuses to be one of them.
    From (3), M(Platypus) is True.
    From (2) and (3), we can conclude that Platypuses are not the mammals with teeth mentioned in (1).
    The premises do not provide information to connect being a mammal to being a reptile.

Let:
    H: Something is a household appliance
    S: Something sucks
Premises:
    Plungers suck. (Plungers are household appliances, so if something is a plunger, it sucks)
    Vacuums suck. (Vacuums are household appliances, so if something is a vacuum, it sucks)
    Vampires suck. (Vampires are not household appliances, so this premise does not directly relate to the conclusion)
    Space is a vacuum. (Space is not a household appliance, so this premise does not directly relate to the conclusion)
    A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck. (Dusters are household appliances, and if something is a duster, it does not suck)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    If something is a household appliance, it sucks, which translates to H → S.
Logical Chain:
    From (1) and (2), we can see that if something is a plunger or a vacuum, it sucks.
    From (5), we know that if something is a duster, it does not suck.
    Since there are household appliances that both suck and do not suck, the statement "If something is a household appliance, it sucks" is not universally true.

Premises:
    If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents. (G → C)
    If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents. (F → ¬C)
    If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages. (GA → G)
    All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience. (AFF → GA)
    All movies in the "Frozen" series are family-friendly animated films. (F_Frozen → AFF)
    “Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film. (This premise is irrelevant to the conclusion)
    “Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. (F_Frozen ∨ G)
Conclusion to Evaluate:
    "Hachi: A dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.
Logical Chain:
    From (7), we know either F_Frozen is True or G is True.

    Let's analyze each possibility:
    * **If F_Frozen is True:**
        * From (5), if F_Frozen is True, then AFF is True.
        * From (4), if AFF is True, then GA is True.
        * From (3), if GA is True, then G is True.
        * Therefore, if F_Frozen is True, then G is True.
        * This contradicts the premise (2) which states that if F is True, then ¬C.
    * **If G is True:**
        * From (1), if G is True, then C is True.
        * This does not contradict any other premises.

    Therefore, the only possible scenario is that G is True.

Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| F | F_Frozen | G | C |
|---|---|---|---|
| True | True | True | False |
| True | False | True | False |
| False | True | True | True |
| False | False | True | True |

Let:
    US: Vladimir has US citizenship
    TW: Vladimir has Taiwanese citizenship
    R: Vladimir is a Russian Federation official
    E: Ekaterina can register to vote in the US
    M: Ekaterina is a Russian Federation official
Premises:
    Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election. (Assumption: This premise does not directly impact the conclusion)
    If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States. (US → E)
    A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship. (US ∨ TW)
    No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship. (R → ¬TW)
    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom. (¬TW ∧ ¬M)
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official. (E ∨ M)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    ¬R (Vladimir is not a Russian federation official)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know ¬TW ∧ ¬M must be true. Therefore, ¬TW = True and ¬M = True.
    From (4), if R were True, then TW would be False, contradicting our derivation from (5). Therefore, R must be False.

    E ∨ R (Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official)
Logical Chain:
    From (6), we know E ∨ R must be True.
    Let's analyze the possibilities:
    * **Case 1: E = True**
        * If E = True, then US must also be True (from premise 1)
        * If US = True, then E = True (from premise 2)

    C → US
    C ∨ T
    ¬(R ∧ T)
    ¬(R ∨ T)
    E ∨ US
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know ¬(R ∨ T) is true.
    This means R must be False and T must be False.
    From (2), if C is True then US is True.
    From (3), C ∨ T must be True. Since T is False, C must be True.
    Therefore, US is True.
    From (1), if E is False then (R ∨ TW) must be True.
    Since R and T are both False, E must be True.

Premises:
    If someone can register to vote in the United States, then they can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election. (E → V)
    If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States. (U → E)
    A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship. (U ∨ ¬U)
    No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship. (R → ¬U)
    Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is a manager at Gazprom. (¬T ∧ ¬R)
    Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official. (E ∨ R)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    ¬(E ∧ V) (It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election)
Logical Chain:
    From (5), we know ¬T ∧ ¬R is True, so ¬T = True and ¬R = True.
    From (6), we know E ∨ R is True. Since ¬R is True, E must be True.
    From (2), if U = True, then E = True.

    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. (C ∧ E) ∨ (¬C ∧ ¬E)
Logical chain:
    From (6), we have two possibilities:
    *  C ∧ E is True, which leads to a contradiction with (5) (C → ¬E)

    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. (Ch ∧ E) ∨ (¬Ch ∧ ¬E)
Logical chain:
    From (6), we know either Ch ∧ E is True, or ¬Ch ∧ ¬E is True.

    * **Case 1: Ch ∧ E is True**
        * From (5), if Ch is True, then E must be False. This contradicts (6), so this case is not possible.

    * **Case 2: ¬Ch ∧ ¬E is True**
        * From (3), if O is True, then Ch is True.
        * From (2), if H is True, then O is True.
        * From (1), if H is True, then C is True.
        * Therefore, if ¬Ch ∧ ¬E is True, then H and C must be False. This contradicts our earlier derivations.

Let:
    M: The mixture contains only one element.
    C: The mixture contains carbon.
    CC: The mixture is a chemical compound.
    A: The mixture is an alkane.
Premises:
    All hydrocarbons are organic compounds.
    All alkanes are hydrocarbons.
    All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
    All organic compounds contain carbon.
    No chemical compounds contain only one element.
    The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither.
Logical Chain:
    From (1), (2), and (3), we know that if something is an alkane, it is also a chemical compound and contains carbon.
    From (4), we know that if something is a chemical compound, it contains carbon.
    From (5), we know that if something is a chemical compound, it cannot contain only one element.
    Therefore, if the mixture is an alkane, it cannot contain only one element.
    The premises state that the mixture is either both a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. 
    Therefore, if the mixture contains only one element, it cannot be a chemical compound.
    Combining these facts, we can conclude that if the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, it cannot be both a chemical compound and an alkane.

Let:
    H: A person is human
    G: A person is Greek
Premises:
    All humans are mortal. (H → M)
    All Greeks are humans. (G → H)
Conclusion to Evaluate: 
    Some Greeks are mortal, which translates to ∃x(G(x) ∧ M(x))
Logical Chain:
    From (2), if G is True, then H must also be True.
    From (1), if H is True, then M must also be True.
    Therefore, if G is True, then M is True.
    This means that there exists at least one Greek who is mortal.
Truth Table (Key Possibilities):
| G (Greek) | H (Human) | M (Mortal) | G ∧ M (Greek and Mortal) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| True       | True      | True      | True                     |

    From (4), if P = True, then D = True
    From (3), if D = True, then CS = True
    From (1), if L ∧ CS were True, then James would work in the library and be in the computer science department, which contradicts the premises. 
    From (2), if PT were True, then L would be True, which also contradicts the premises.
    Therefore, both PT and L must be False.
