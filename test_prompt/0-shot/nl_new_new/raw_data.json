Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
