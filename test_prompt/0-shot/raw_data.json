Since Hannah is at Mary's school and works in student jobs on campus, she cannot order takeout frequently (otherwise, she would not work in student jobs). Therefore, she must enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.\n   - From the fourth and fifth premises, since Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, she is not picky and spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\n   - The sixth premise states that if Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. This is a contradiction because we have established that she enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, which implies she is not picky and spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. Therefore, she does not need to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n\n4. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Since Hannah works in student jobs on campus, she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. However, the sixth premise contradicts this by stating that if she needs to earn money, she is neither picky nor needs to earn money, which is a contradiction with the fact that she enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes.\n   - Therefore, the statement that Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition is false.\n\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>",

(C \u2228 D)\nLogical Chain:\n    From (7), we know A \u2228 B is True.\n    If A is True, then \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is a family-friendly animated film and is in the \"Frozen\" series (D is True).\n    If B is True, then \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is appropriate for people of all ages, and by (1), children can watch it without guidance from parents, implying C is False.\n    Therefore, if B is True, C \u2228 D is True because D is True.\n    If A is True, C \u2228 D is also True.\n    Hence, (A \u2228 B) \u2192 (C \u2228 D) is True.\nTruth Table (Key Possibilities):\n| A (Family-friendly animated film) | B (Appropriate for all ages) | C (Excessive erotic and violent content) | D (Frozen series) | A \u2228 B | C \u2228 D | (A \u2228 B) \u2192 (C \u2228 D) |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|-------|-------------------|\n| True                             | True                        | False                                   | True              | True  | True  | True              |\n| True                             | False                       | False                                   | True              | True  | True  | True              |\n| False                            | True                        | False                                   | False             | True  | False | False             |\n| False                            | False                       | False                                   | False             | False | False | True              |\n<end_of_truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (A).\n<end_of_answer>",
