Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

This means if she is either of these things, she must be female.\n    - We need to see if there's a path to either Coco Gauff being ranked highly by the WTA or losing to Nadal.\n    - (1) states that if someone is ranked highly by the WTA, they are one of the most active players in major tennis.\n    - (2) states that everyone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA.\n    - (3) states that all female players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n    - From these premises, we can infer that if Coco Gauff is female and at Roland Garros 2022, then she must have lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n    - (5) states that all male players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.\n    - Therefore, if Coco Gauff is male and at Roland Garros 2022, then she must have lost to Rafael Nadal.\n    - We need more information to definitively say if Coco Gauff is female or male.\n\nStep 5:  Conclusion\n    - The premise (6) provides a conditional statement, but it doesn't tell us if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Nadal. \n    - Without more information about Coco Gauff's status at Roland Garros 2022 (whether she is female or male), we cannot definitively say if she lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\n\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>",

This is a crucial piece of information.\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion.\n    - The conclusion \"Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer\" is not directly supported by any of the premises. \n    - While we know severe cancers are deadly, and colorectal cancer is not both bile duct cancer and has a low survival rate, this doesn't automatically make it a severe cancer.\nStep 5: Determine the final answer.\n    - Based on the analysis, the conclusion \"Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer\" is uncertain. \n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>",

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input.

The theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher.\n</question>\n<options>\n(A) True\n(B) False\n(C) Uncertain\n</options>\n<nl_cot>\nStep 1: From the premise \u201cAll philosophers reason,\u201d we know that if someone is a philosopher, then that individual necessarily has the ability to reason.\nStep 2: From the premise \u201cAll who can reason can distinguish truth from falsehood,\u201d we conclude that if someone reasons, they will also distinguish truth from falsehood.\nStep 3: The premise \u201cNobody who can distinguish truth from falsehood is morally perfect\u201d implies that if one does indeed distinguish truth from falsehood, they cannot be morally perfect.\nStep 4: Since the theistic God is stated to be \u201cmorally perfect,\u201d if the theistic God were a philosopher, He would have to reason (by Step 1), which would lead to distinguishing truth from falsehood (by Step 2), thereby making Him not morally perfect (by Step 3). This contradicts the premise that the theistic God is morally perfect, so He cannot be a philosopher.\nStep 5: Separately, the premise says \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist.\u201d We also know \u201cSome sophists reason,\u201d which does not imply that every sophist necessarily reasons. Hence, there is no guaranteed contradiction in being a sophist while remaining morally perfect\u2014He could be the sort of sophist who does not reason.\nStep 6: Because the theistic God cannot be both morally perfect and a philosopher, the statement \u201cThe theistic God is a sophist and a philosopher\u201d is false.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 2>\n\n<EXAMPLE 3>\n<premises>\nWilliam Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh. \nThe University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom. \nWilliam Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs. \nPeople who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Although many readers might know from general knowledge that Westminster School is in London, the text itself does not provide this information.\nStep 3: Since the conclusion claims that \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university,\u201d we can confirm the university part is in the UK but have insufficient information about the high school (Westminster School).\nStep 4: Because the premise does not definitively place Westminster School in the UK, it is impossible to conclude with certainty that both schools he attended were in the UK. We therefore lack enough textual evidence to deem the conclusion strictly true.\nStep 5: There is also no premise suggesting that Westminster School is outside of the UK, so we cannot declare the conclusion false. The conclusion could be true in reality, but the text does not confirm it.\nStep 6: As a result, the statement \u201cWilliam Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university\u201d remains unverified by the given premises and is thus uncertain.\n<end_of_nl_cot>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>\n</EXAMPLE 3>\n\n\nThe following is the problem you need to solve.\n\n<premises>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\nN\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
