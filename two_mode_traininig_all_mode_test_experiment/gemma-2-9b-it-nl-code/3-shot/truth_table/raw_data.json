Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

Your task is to answer a logical reasoning problem strictly following one of three modes, as explicitly specified in the input. Only one mode will be present in the input. Follow that mode exclusively.\n\n- Code Mode (`<code> ... <end_of_code> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<code>`, translate the problem into Python code.  \n  - Execute the logic and derive the answer.  \n\n- Natural Language Chain-of-Thought Mode (`<nl_cot> ... <end_of_nl_cot> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<nl_cot>`, solve the problem step by step in natural language.  \n\n- Truth Table Mode (`<truth_table> ... <end_of_truth_table> <answer> ... <end_of_answer>`)  \n  - If the input contains `<truth_table>`, construct a truth table and derive the answer from it.  \n\n### Rules  \n- Only use the mode specified in the input. Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
