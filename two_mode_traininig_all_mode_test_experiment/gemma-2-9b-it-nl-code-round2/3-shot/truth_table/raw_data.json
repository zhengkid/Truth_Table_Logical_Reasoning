We know Rockie is calm and can be spotted near the campus.\n2. From the premise \"If something is skittish, then it is not calm,\" we can deduce that Rockie is not skittish.\n3.  Since Rockie is not skittish, it cannot be a squirrel (premise \"All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish\").\n4.  Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit (premise \"The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels\").\n5.  Finally, we know \"All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute,\" so Rockie is cute.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile we know Rockie is a rabbit, the premises do not state that all rabbits are turtles.  Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Rockie is a turtle.\n\n<end_of_truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (C).\n<end_of_answer>",

Combining these, we can deduce that if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, then he is an athlete.\n\nStep 3:  The premise states \"If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous\".

We also know that all bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. Therefore, Harry cannot be a bee, and thus cannot be a queen bee. Since Harry is not a bee, he is not an invertebrate.\n\n    * **Possibility 2:** If Harry is neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then he must be an invertebrate.  The conclusion states that in this case, Harry is not an invertebrate. This contradicts our deduction.\n\nStep 4: Since the conclusion is false in Possibility 2, the entire conditional statement is false.\n\n<end_of_truth_table>\n<answer>\nThe final answer is (B).\n<end_of_answer>",

From premises 1 and 2, we know that if something is a Tesla Model 3, then it cannot be a one-seater.\n2. From premises 3 and 4, we know that if something is a Solo EV, then it is a single-seat electric car.\n3. Combining 1 and 2, we see that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be a Solo EV.\n4. From premise 5, we know that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it cannot be a single-seat electric car.\n5. Therefore, the only way for John's car to be a Solo EV is if it is a Tesla Model 3.\n6.

Since all family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience (Premise 4) and all movies in the \"Frozen\" series are family-friendly animated films (Premise 5), this possibility implies that \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" must be in the \"Frozen\" series. However, the premises do not state that any \"Frozen\" films contain excessive erotic and violent content. Therefore, this possibility is uncertain.\n* **Possibility 2:** If \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is neither a family-friendly animated film nor in the \"Frozen\" series, it must be a film that is appropriate for all ages (Premise 7).  Since films appropriate for all ages are not those containing excessive erotic and violent content (Premise 2), this possibility is supported by the premises.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBecause Possibility 2 is supported by the premises, and Possibility 1 is uncertain, we can conclude that \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the \"Frozen\" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the \"Frozen\" series. \n\n\n<end_of_answer>",

Do not switch modes.  \n- Generate output strictly in the specified mode and format, with no additional text.  \n- Enclose all reasoning strictly within the corresponding mode tags.  \n- The final answer must be strictly enclosed in `<answer> ... <end_of_answer>`.  \n- Do not provide any reasoning or explanations outside of the designated mode tags.  \n\n\nBelow are three examples that demonstrate the desired style:\n\n<EXAMPLE 1>\n<premises>\nPeter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian.\nThe Hulk is a destroyer.\nThe Hulk wakes up when he is angry.\nIf the Hulk wakes up, then he will break a bridge.\nThor is a god.\nThor will break a bridge when he is happy.\nA god is not a destroyer.\nPeter Parker wears a uniform when he is a superhero.\nPeter Parker is not a civilian if a destroyer is breaking a bridge.\nIf Thor is happy, the Hulk is angry.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nIf Thor is happy, then Peter Parker wears a uniform.\n</conclusion>\n<question>\nIs the following statement true, false, or uncertain?
